Semele,John Eccles,,,,17th,William Congreve," is an opera by , written in about 1706 with a libretto by  drawing on the  myth from 's . It forms part of the English opera tradition of 's , but was never staged due to changes in popular taste at the time. Indeed, the opera remained unperformed until the mid twentieth century, eclipsed by 's 1744 secular oratorio , based on the same libretto.
In his introductory 'argument', Congreve briefly summarises the plot, explains why he has modified some of Ovid's story, and then goes on to explain for the audience's benefit the concept of musical :
 is about to be married against her will to Prince , though she loves the god . Jupiter's thunder interrupts the ceremony, and Athamus finds himself left alone with , Semele's sister. Ino is professing her love for Athamus when  enters to announce that Semele has been carried off to heaven by Jupiter in the form of an eagle.
, jealous wife of Jupiter, has instructed her handmaid Iris to find out where Semele and her husband are. Iris says that they are in his palace, guarded by dragons. Within the palace, Jupiter and Semele sing of their mutual love but Semele is not satisfied, realising that as a mortal her happiness must be transitory. Jupiter attempts to divert her from such thoughts, and to provide entertainment arranges for Ino to visit her.
Juno, accompanied by Iris, visit the god  and asks to borrow his magic rod to charm the dragons. She gets Somnus to put Ino to sleep so that she can take her place. Disguised as Ino, Juno falsely tells Semele that she has the opportunity to become immortal if only she can persuade Jupiter to appear before her as he really is, in his natural godly state. When Semele and Jupiter are alone, Semele first secures from him a vow that he will do whatever she asks, and then she demands that he appear as a god. Jupiter warns her of her folly but is unable to persuade her to change her mind. He carries out the vow, appearing with his most gentle fire and lightning, but is unable to save her from being destroyed. In the final scene, Ino marries Athamus and Apollo prophesies that , the unborn child of Jupiter and Semele, will rise from Semele's ashes.
Eccles probably completed the score of  in late 1706, basing his music on a libretto of 1705–6 by his close friend . The opera may been intended to open 's new  in  in 1707, but that became impossible when the  gave Vanbrugh's competitor  at the  a monopoly on opera productions in London. Congreve and Eccles were forced to agree to a production at Drury Lane, but Rich never brought it to the stage. Congreve published his libretto in 1710, but Eccles's music remained unheard, with popular fashion turning towards the Italianate style of . Congreve's libretto was later re-used, in slightly amended form, by  for his secular oratorio .
Eccles'  forms part of the English opera tradition that had begun with 's  (c1683) and included 's  (c. 1685–9). The non-performance of the opera in 1707 confirmed the end of this short-lived tradition. According to the ,  was 'in every way superior' to the other operas that were being performed in London at the time. The lack of productions in later years is attributable to the fact that modern directors have found Handel's greater setting of the same libretto so easy to turn into an opera.

Orlando furioso,Antonio Vivaldi,1714,"Teatro Sant'Angelo, Venice",Italian,17th,Grazio Braccioli,"  819 (, , Venice 1714) is a three-act opera surviving in manuscript in 's personal library, only partly related to his better known  of 1727. It is a recomposition of an  written by  which had been very successfully staged by Vivaldi and his father's  in 1713, and whose music survives in a few fragments retained in the score of RV 819. Therefore, Vivaldi's first cataloguer  did not assign the opera a RV number, but catalogued it as RV Anh. 84. The libretto was by .
, according to the studies of , argues that Orlando RV 819 was entirely recomposed by Vivaldi, starting from the original Ristori's opera that Vivaldi himself had already changed during the numerous representations of the season 1713. He assigned to it the catalogue number RV 819. One suggestion is that Vivaldi avoided putting his own name on the opera having himself only recently taken direction of the . Against this others consider that the bulk of the opera is a copy of Ristori's lost work.
Unlike the  of 1727, in which the role of Orlando is sung by a contralto, the 1714 opera assigns the title role to a bass. The third act is missing and the rest of the score (evidently used in performances by the composer) is incomplete. Two arias are lost, seven arias are incomplete (only the bass part is extant) and three arias are identical with extant arias in RV 727 and RV 729.
The French label , which had already recorded the more famous  and  for its Vivaldi Edition, released a recording of the July 20, 2012 première at the , with Sardelli conducting  and singers including Riccardo Novaro as Orlando,  as Angelica, Romina Basso as Alcina and  as Bradamante. Given the heavily defective nature of the surviving manuscript, Sardelli had to reconstruct or compose  the seven incomplete arias, in a Vivaldian style.

Partenope,Manuel de Zumaya,1 May 1711,Mexico City,Spanish,17th,Zumaya," is an  in three acts by . Zumaya adapted the  himself from a Spanish translation of 's Italian libretto which was first set for performance in Naples during 1699 with music by .  All told, Stampiglia's libretto was used by a variety of composers for more than a dozen operas that were produced all over Italy, including versions by  and . Zumaya's version was commissioned by Viceroy Fernando de Alencastre Noroña y Silva and produced at the viceroyal palace in  on 1 May 1711. The production is the earliest known full opera produced in  and the first opera written by an American-born composer. However,  is not the earliest opera to be performed in the , as some sources have reported. That distinction belongs to 's , which premiered ten years earlier in , .
 may not have been the first stage work by Zumaya that contained music. He had previously written the play  for the birth of  in 1708. It is possible that he may have also composed music for this play. Unfortunately, both the score of Zumaya's opera and any music he may have written for the play has now been lost.
Stampiglia wrote his libretto just before the beginning of the , which largely started due to the collapse of complicated negotiations over lands in all parts of Europe, especially in Italy. The story of this libretto reflects the kinds of political intrigues occurring in Italy, Spain, and many other European nations prior to the onset of the War. The story resonated well with audiences of the day because they recognized the political confusion as reflective of their times. This is one reason why Zumaya and so many other composers chose to use Stampiglia's libretto during the early eighteenth century.
In Stampiglia's original libretto, the characters are as follows:
Zumaya adds the characters Anfrisa and Beltran
Partenope (or ) appears in  and classical literature and art as one of the  who taunted . One version of the tale depicts her throwing herself into the sea because her love for Odysseus was not returned. She drowns and her body washes up on the shore of Naples, which was called Partenope after her name. From this, Silvio Stampiglia created a fictional account where Partenope appears as the Queen of Naples.
Handel's opera  which also uses a version of Stampiglia's libretto, has the following outline.
Prince Arsace and Prince Armindo are seeking Queen Partenope, the founder of the city of , in marriage.  Meanwhile, Prince Emilio is at war with Naples and with Partenope.  Partenope is primarily attracted to Arsace.  However, she does not know that Arsace has previously abandoned Rosmira, who is disguised as a man, named Eurimene, and is trying to win him back.  Rosmira, as Eurimene, confronts him and harasses him for his faithlessness, and demands that he keep her true identity secret.  Ultimately, Rosmira/Eurimene challenges her lover to a duel in a court of honour, but her identity is revealed when he demands the condition that they fight stripped to the waist.

Ersilla dedicates a sword to the destruction of Orlando, and entrusts the sword and mission to Argillano, who secretly loves her. Ersilla’s enemies, Brandimarte, Grifone and Origille spy on the rituals. As the ceremony ends, Tigrinda, priestess of potions, tries unsuccessfully to tell Argillano she loves him. Grifone follows Tigrinda, who he in turn secretly loves. Argillano challenges Grifone, who is protected by Origille – she pretends that he is her young sister, “Leodilla.” Origille, who is pledged to Grifone, challenges his obvious love for Tigrinda, then vows her revenge. Orlando defeats but spares Argillano, leaving the magic sword on the ground as he severs the golden branch, thus opening the way for everyone into Ersilla’s garden. Ersilla notices the sword, and infers Argillano’s defeat. As her fairies bewitch Orlando with their songs, Ersilla becomes smitten with Brandimarte, who uses this to rescue Orlando.
Grifone tries to capitalise on his reluctant disguise to get closer to Tigrinda by becoming her handmaiden. Origille, now disguised as a man, “Ordauro,” interrupts them. Ersilla ignores Tigrinda’s pleas for Argillano’s release (imprisoned because of his defeat,) but now smitten with “Ordauro,” releases him at “Ordauro’s” suggestion. Spurned by Ersilla, Argillano vows to betray her, and to gain an accomplice, falsely pledges his love to Tigrinda. On seeing Origille, Orlando blows his cover, but is neatly manoeuvred by Brandimarte into concealing his true identity by pretending to be mad, under the illusion that he is Orlando. Under cover of “madness,” Orlando tells the bizarre story of how Origille betrayed him last time they met. When Argillano disappears to warn Ersilla of his suspicions, Origille begs forgiveness, and Orlando acquiesces. Argillano tells Ersilla that “Leodilla” is Grifone, and she interrogates him. Grifone gives nothing away, and so is imprisoned.
Origille has smashed through Grifone’s prison wall with a pickaxe, and confronts him with her ardent love. Grifone’s pledges of love are rejected by Tigrinda, who then plots with a reluctant Argillano to poison Ersilla with a magic potion. Ersilla’s darkest ceremony fails to reveal Orlando’s true identity, so she conjures up a counterfeit Angelica to provoke him. Brandimarte again rescues Orlando, this time by pretending himself to be the warrior. Ersilla captures the two men, but is mortified to believe she loves her enemy. Orlando vows to abandon such deception in favour of honourable confrontation. Argillano rejects Tigrinda, who then drinks her own potion. Grief-stricken, Grifone, too poisons himself. Origille, seeing the corpse of her beloved, vows revenge. Orlando smashes his fetters, releases Brandimarte, and by destroying Ersilla’s castle, breaks all her spells.  Grifone, Tigrinda, and all her other victims reawaken and are cured, Tigrinda is united with Argillano, Origille with Grifone, and all ends happily.

Unusually for the period, it ends in a . What interested Handel was the emotions and the sufferings of the four characters. not the descriptive effects of his later ""magic"" operas. The sole preoccupation of each of the protagonists is to make the others fall in or out of love with them. Handel went deeper into their sentiments than he ever would again.
According to  the quality of the score, especially the first two acts, is remarkably high, but it shows less careful organization than most of the later operas. He also states that the tonal design seems off balance. The conception of an opera as a coherent structural organism was slow to capture Handel's imagination.
The four personalities are differentiated in character. Handel made prominent use of wind instruments, so the score is colorful, comparable to his . He used oboes, bassoon and recorders to render emotions. A single trumpet is at times combined with an oboe. While this may have had financial reasons, it became an interesting orchestral sound.
The libretto is an adaptation of a medieval Spanish    in which the King of , educated in Scotland, falls in love with and eventually marries Oriana, daughter of the King of England.
 by  is a prose pastoral romance written towards the close of the fourteenth century. Like any romance of chivalry,  is a nightmare to summarise owing to its length, numerous characters, and complicated subplots. The work has a complicated history.

Oriana was heiress to the throne of England. Amadis of Gaul is a prince born of a secret amour, educated in Scotland, reared as a knight, and serving devotedly the fair English princess Oriana. For her sake, he contends against monsters and enchantments, and defends her father's kingdom from an oppressor. Richard B. Beams wrote: 
The plot ranges across the continent to  and Constantinople, and in the continuations as far as the  and the . However, the romance's geography cannot be mapped onto the ""real"" Europe: it contains just as many fantastic places as real ones.  Historically,  was very influential amongst the Spanish .  mentioned the wonders of  upon witnessing the wonders of the New World – and such place names as  and  come directly from the work. David Kimbell compared in detail the treatments of the story by Handel and Destouches.
Amadigi, a , and Dardano, the Prince of , are both enamoured with , the daughter of the King of the Fortunate Isles. Oriana prefers Amadigi in her affections. Also attracted to Amadigi is the sorceress , who tries to capture Amadigi's affections by various spells, pleadings and even threats. Amadigi confronts various spirits and furies, but rebuffs them at practically every turn. One particular vision at the ""Fountain of True Love"", however, of Oriana courting Dardano upsets Amadigi to the point that he faints. Oriana sees Amadigi prostrate, and is about to stab herself with his sword when he awakens. He immediately berates her for her apparent betrayal of him, and in his turn tries to stab himself.
Still alive, Amadigi continues to resist the advances of Melissa. Melissa then makes Dardano look like Amadigi, to deceive Oriana. Oriana follows Dardano, in the visage of Amadigi, to beg his pardon. Dardano exults in the attention of Oriana, and in an impulsive moment, challenges Amadigi to single combat. In the duel, Amadigi kills Dardano. Melissa accuses Oriana of stealing Amadigi from her, and calls upon dark spirits to assault Oriana, who resists all of Melissa's incantations.
Dardano's celebrated aria  from Act 2 is notable for its prominent  part and its chord sequence based on the  or, rather, circle of fourths. The introduction is shown in the score as one of the .
Amadigi and Oriana have been imprisoned by Melissa. The two lovers are willing to sacrifice themselves for each other. Though desirous of revenge, Melissa cannot quite yet kill Amadigi, but torments him by prolonging his confinement in chains. Amadigi and Oriana ask Melissa for mercy. Melissa summons the ghost of Dardano to assist her in her revenge, but the ghost says that the gods are predisposed to protect Amadigi and Oriana, and that their trials are nearly done. Rejected on all levels, by the gods, the underworld spirits, and Amadigi, Melissa takes her own life, with one final plea to Amadigi to feel a shade of pity for her. In the manner of a , Orgando, uncle of Oriana and a sorcerer himself, descends from the sky in a chariot and blesses the union of Amadigi and Oriana. A dance of shepherds and shepherdesses concludes the opera.

Dorotea then appears disguised as the ""Queen of Micomicona"" accompanied by her ""squire"" (Ordogno in disguise) and her ""tutor"" (Cardenio in disguise). She asks Don Chisciotte's help to regain her throne which has been usurped by the giant ""Pandafilando"". The road to ""Micomicona"" will pass through Don Chisciotte's homeland, . As a gesture of thanks for his help and a token of her ""love"", she will make him the lord of La Mancha. Don Chisciotte promises her his help but not his love.

The drama opens in a forest where Venus has been hunting. Her  rush onstage, crying that she is being chased by a . Adonis rushes to her aid. Venus faints in his arms as he carries her on-stage. When she recovers, Adonis learns her true identity. He explains that the incestuous circumstances of his birth have made him renounce love forever and that he must flee from her. As Venus starts to pursue Adonis, her lover, Marte, appears and questions her. Dissatisfied with her answers, he then interrogates her nymphs, eventually  frightening one of them into describing Venus' rescue by Adonis. , Marte's sister, arrives on  and summons him to combat to distract him from his jealousy.
The peasants, Chato and Celfa, joke about marriage but are interrupted by a chorus of peasants exclaiming that the wild boar is on the loose. Adonis pursues the boar, but then tires and lies down to rest. Venus comes upon the sleeping Adonis and torn by the humiliation of having fainted in his arms and her growing desire for him, she dismisses her nymphs. She calls on  to help her and tells him about Adonis's renunciation of love. Amor shoots the sleeping Adonis in the heart with one of his golden arrows, infusing him with desire. When Adonis awakens, he is surprised to find Venus watching him, and sings of his terrible dream about a wild boar, a dream which foreshadows his death. Adonis praises Venus's beauty and confesses his attraction to her. Venus is unable to tear herself away from Adonis, and they reveal their mutual desire. Venus enters her garden of delights and Adonis follows her, welcomed by Celfa, Chato, and the nymphs. 
The next scene finds Marte, Belona, Dragón and Belona's soldiers at the foot of a mountain. Marte is still jealous and distracted. Belona and Dragón try to humor him. Meanwhile, Amor is sneaking around in disguise, spying on Marte. He is eventually discovered hiding in the bushes and interrogated by Marte, who fails to recognize him, but is suspicious of his riddles about love. When Marte orders the soldiers to capture him, Amor escapes into a cleft in the mountain. The cleft then opens revealing the Prison of Jealousy. Shackled inside, is Desengaño (Disillusion), an old man  dressed in animal skins. Marte and Dragón fearfully enter the grotto and find the masked personifications of Fear, Suspicion, Envy, Anger, and Bitterness. Desengaño and the masked figures warn Marte that when love is pursued it turns into disillusion. Desengaño holds up a magic mirror in which Marte sees Venus and Adonis embracing. Unable to face the truth, Marte runs away. There is a sudden earthquake, and the allegorical figures, the vision in the mirror, and the grotto all disappear.
In Venus's garden, Venus and Adonis delight in their illicit love. Adonis reclines in Venus's lap, while Chato, Celfa, and the nymphs, sing to the couple. Amor arrives and warns them of Marte's anger. Venus tells Adonis to return to the forest and plots to subdue Marte. When Marte arrives, the songs of the nymphs and vapors from the garden's fountains induce him to languor. Belona enters bringing a chorus of soldiers to counteract the spell cast by the nymphs' singing. Revived by the soldiers' songs, Marte heads for the forest looking for Adonis, who is again chasing the wild boar that had alarmed the peasants. Dragging Chato and Celfa off with him, Marte orders Dragón to tie them to a tree. Marte commands , one of the , to make the boar especially vicious, so that Adonis will die. Chato, Celfa, and Dragón have a comic argument about bullies and neglectful husbands, culminating with Dragón beating Celfa as Chato cheers him on.
In the forest, Adonis has been mortally wounded by the boar. Venus hears his cries and rushes to the scene. Seeing the distraught goddess with her hair loose, half naked, and her hands bloodstained, Belona is moved to pity and sings a lament. She and the nymph, Libia, try to convince Venus not to look at Adonis' body. The chorus describes how the blood of Adonis is turning the white roses around him red. Venus calls upon the gods with a lament. Marte cruelly describes the death of Adonis to Venus, and reveals his bloody body lying among the roses. Venus laments and faints. Amor then appears from the sky to announce that  has been moved by the plight of the lovers and will elevate them together to   – Adonis in the form of a flower (an ) and Venus as the . Marte, Venus, Adonis, and Belona all comment, and as the sun sets, Venus and Adonis ascend to the heavens.
There is a single source of Torrejón's opera at the  in ; a second manuscript preserved at the  at  in  does not contain music. A partial copy of the music in draft format, which closely follows the Lima source, was recently found in Cusco. 
Musicologist  published the first modern edition in Lima in 1976. A second one, by Don Cruickshank, is included in a scholarly study of the piece published by Reichenberger (Kassel) in 1990. A third publication of the music was issued in Madrid by the Instituto Complutense de Ciencias Musicales, under the editorship of Louis Stein (1999). Other  editions, currently in manuscript, were prepared by Bernardo Illari for performances at Bloomington, Geneva, and Madrid in 1999, and by Diana Fernández Calvo for an Israeli production in 2013. Contrary to what was previously believed, the source provides music for the whole of Calderón's poem. It has some lacunas, including a missing chorus and a condensed presentation of the scene in Venus's garden (beginning at lines 1570, measure 2847 of the Kassel edition). Recent revivals of the opera have added the necessary music in an attempt to create what may have been heard in 1701. 
The music by Torrejón conserves much of the character and the idiosyncrasies contained in the comedies of Calderón as previously set by Juan Hidalgo. Torrejón may have been one of Hidalgo's pupils and liberally used the music of his predecessor, in an extended dialogue with him. The score makes use of a variety of Spanish song types, with no Latin American musical influences. The erotic nature of the text is heightened by the use of dance rhythms, musical repetitions, and sensual lyrical lines. The exact instrumentation has not been found in Torrejón y Velasco's surviving original scores. However, the scores of other late seventeenth century musical plays in Spain suggest that the instruments would include harps, guitars, viols, violins,  and regular trumpets, drums, and .

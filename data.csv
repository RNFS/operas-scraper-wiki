La voix humaine,Francis Poulenc,6 February 1959,"Opéra-Comique, Paris",French,1959,," (English: ) is a forty-minute, one-act  for  and orchestra composed by  in 1958. The work is based on the play  by , who, along with French soprano , worked closely with Poulenc in preparation for the opera's premiere. Poulenc's  was first performed at the  in Paris on 6 February 1959, with Duval as the solo singer and  conducting; the scenery, costumes and direction were by Cocteau.
The  consists of a woman's last phone conversation with her lover, who now loves someone else. During the call, the woman reveals that she has attempted suicide because her lover has abandoned her.
Cocteau finished writing  in 1928, and the  was premiered two years later. Having been previously criticized for using mechanical effects in his plays, Cocteau sought to reduce his drama to the ""simplest of forms"". Indeed, the one-act play involves a single character in a single room with a telephone. The character — an anonymous woman referred to only as ""Elle"" (""she"" in French) — has been abandoned by her lover and reveals that she has attempted to commit suicide. The play consists of her last conversation with her lover. As a one-act play, the drama lacks the breaks that would traditionally determine its structure. Instead, Cocteau suggests that the actress's different poses represent different ""phases"" of the monologue. The structure of the play is further delineated by the phone cutting off frequently without warning.
Upon the success of his second opera  in 1957, Poulenc was encouraged to compose more works in the genre. Hervé Dugardin, the Paris director of , suggested that Poulenc set Cocteau's monodrama to music, with  singing the role of Elle. Poulenc, however, wrote the opera specifically for Denise Duval, who had starred as Blanche de la Force in the  premiere of . Poulenc's close work with Duval helped his compositional process because he ""knew the details of the soprano's stormy love life, and this helped to cultivate a sense of specificity in the opera."" Poulenc also identified with Elle's situation, which allowed him to ""pour immense anguish into his opera… Like her he abused sleeping pills, tranquilizers and anti-depressants."" He thus immersed himself in a deeply personal project with which he easily connected.
Poulenc met Cocteau early in his career because of the latter's close relationship with , a group of six French composers of which Poulenc was a member. The two maintained a close friendship throughout their lives, but Poulenc did not set many of Cocteau's texts prior the composition of , about forty years after their first encounter. Poulenc himself explained that he waited so many years to set Cocteau's play because he felt that he needed a great deal of experience to perfectly construct such a work.
In composing , Poulenc strove to maintain the emotional effectiveness of Cocteau's original drama. He very carefully adapted Cocteau's text, omitting only those passages that he believed would reduce the emotional tension of the opera. In his article on Poulenc and Cocteau, Denis Waleckx proposes that there are five types of ""phases"" in Cocteau's play. These phases deal with chronology, psychological evolution, social interaction, telephone problems, and the ""remembrance of past happiness"". Poulenc left the chronology, telephone problem, and past happiness phases mostly intact, but cut down on or entirely omitted many of the psychological or social phases. This resulted in a protagonist who was ""quieter, more modest, less hysterical, less unbearable, and thereby probably more touching than Cocteau's."" Poulenc thereby focused on the relationship of the woman and her lover, while still retaining the key points and overall character of Cocteau's play.
Poulenc viewed the soprano singing the role of Elle as ""a co-composer"" of the part. Because Poulenc wrote the role specifically for Duval, the French soprano was his original ""co-composer"". Duval also helped Poulenc with his adaptation of Cocteau's text. Upon the opera's completion, Poulenc and Duval visited Cocteau, who was responsible for directing and designing costumes and stage décor for the premiere. Cocteau worked closely with Duval and adapted his directions for lighting and costuming to complement her physical attributes.
Poulenc finished his score for voice and piano on 2 June 1958 and spent the next two months orchestrating the work, completing the version for full orchestra on 7 August 1958. The  was premiered on 6 February 1959 at the Opéra-Comique, Paris, with Georges Prêtre conducting and Duval performing the role of Elle. The opera met immediate success and went on to be performed at  in Milan, as well as in Portugal, Britain, and the United States.
The curtain opens to reveal a bedroom where a woman (Elle) lies unmoving on the ground. Elle changes position once before finally rising. Although Elle makes to leave the room, the phone rings and Elle returns to answer it. Elle receives two wrong numbers before her ex-lover is able to get through to her. Elle lies to him, saying that she went out with her friend Marthe the previous night, and that she took one pill to help her fall asleep when she returned. The couple discusses their past relationship, and Elle blames herself for their problems, claiming, ""Tout est ma faute."" Throughout their conversation, they experience numerous telephone problems, and their connection finally cuts out completely. When Elle calls her lover's home phone, she discovers that he is not there and assumes that he is at a restaurant. He calls her back, and Elle reveals that she has lied during their conversation; instead of going out with Marthe the previous night, she took twelve sleeping pills in an attempted suicide. She then called Marthe, who arrived with a doctor to save her. Elle suddenly hears music in the background, and grows suspicious that her lover is at the home of his new girlfriend. Elle expresses her suspicions to him several times until the end of the opera, but he never admits to his true location. Elle also reveals her obsession with the telephone, explaining that she has slept with it in her bed for the past two nights. Their connection fails once again, and Elle panics. Her lover calls her back once more, and Elle informs him that she now has the telephone cord wrapped around her neck. Telling him she loves him over and over, she sinks into her bed and drops the receiver.
 is scored for full symphony orchestra with reduced dimensions, so that the sung text is easily understandable. The entire orchestra rarely plays at once; such moments occur only when the soprano does not sing, or when her voice lyrically rises above the orchestra. Poulenc writes coloristically, using different combinations of instruments to achieve certain effects. The instrumentation listed in Poulenc's score is as follows:
Poulenc did not sanction public performances of the opera in the version with piano accompaniment during his lifetime. In the 2010s, Rosine Seringe, Poulenc's niece, gave dispensation to  and  to record a performance for DVD of the piano accompaniment version, which appeared in 2013 as the first commercial recording of this version. Subsequently, recordings and live performances of the piano accompaniment version of the opera have increased in frequency.
Poulenc's writing for the voice is recitative-like in style, representing the natural inflections of speech and, in the case of this particular drama, imitating a phone conversation through its frequent pauses and silences. Poulenc rejects his previous lyricism, opting for a fragmentary, declamatory approach to the voice. Common characteristics of Poulenc's vocal lines include multiple repeated notes, few intervals greater than a fifth, much step-wise motion and motion by a third, and rhythm and accents designed to reflect actual speech patterns, especially ""the pauses and hesitations of a phone conversation."" Keith W. Daniel notes that out of the 780 measures of music in Poulenc's work, 186 are for solo voice without orchestral accompaniment, adding to the impression of a real telephone conversation. Many of the techniques described above are present in Example 1.
Poulenc strays from the recitative in highly dramatic passages, including when Elle sings of her suicide attempt of the previous night. This section is more lyrical and tonal, as can be seen in Example 2. Here, the vocal line more resembles an aria, especially as it builds toward its high point in the nine-eight measure, and the orchestra accompanies the voice in a waltz. The harmony, meanwhile, is a dominant prolongation in C (minor), and indeed, the orchestra resolves to C (major) in the following measure. Poulenc's vocal writing shows a strong dedication to maintaining the dramatic effect of Cocteau's text. The recitative-like passages clearly deliver the libretto, while the aria-like passages illustrate the soprano's passion and anguish.
Poulenc uses the orchestra to connect the soprano's fragmented vocal lines, unifying the piece as a whole. Unlike his treatment of the soprano voice, Poulenc gives the orchestra many lyrical , writing in the preface his score, ""L'œuvre entière doit baigner dans la plus grande sensualité orchestrale"" (""The entire work must bathe in the largest orchestral sensuality""). He unifies the opera through these motifs, of which Denis Waleckx identifies fourteen. These motifs relate to Elle's state of mind, such as those representing her ""exasperated waiting,"" and to situations out of her control, such as her ""happy memory."" The first of these motifs is shown in Example 3.
Daniel, however, suggests that only nine of Waleckx's examples are true motifs, while the remaining one- or two-bar phrases employ a cellular technique in which a short phrase is presented, then repeated once or twice. What Waleckx cites as the ""Endurance"" motif (see Example 4), Daniel uses to illustrate Poulenc's cellular technique. Despite their different interpretations, both authors agree that the primary function of the orchestra is to unify the opera into a cohesive work. As Daniel explains, ""If  succeeds as a drama, it is because of the vocal writing; but if it succeeds as a piece of music, as an opera, it is because of the orchestra.""
Other functions of the orchestra include the representation of Elle's agitation while trying to reach her lover and the jazz she hears on her lover's side of the phone conversation. Musicologist and professor Michal Grover-Friedlander also suggests that the orchestral music can symbolize the lover's side of the phone conversation. Perhaps the most important orchestral function other than unifying the overall work is the portrayal of the telephone ringing through repeated sixteenth notes on the xylophone, shown in Example 5. Although the pitch and the duration of the ringing changes throughout the opera, the timbre of the xylophone is only ever used to represent the ""voice"" of the telephone, making it easily identifiable. The phone cutting off and re-ringing divides the opera into natural sections and creates a comprehensible structure through which the audience understands the drama. The orchestra is therefore essential to unifying and organizing the opera.
 stands out from Poulenc's previous works because it is marked by a certain  ambiguity. Poulenc achieves this sensation through the avoidance of traditional harmonic functions and the preponderance of unresolved dissonances, diminished structures, and progressions of chromatically-related chords. Although some passages—most often those in which the voice becomes more lyrical—have a clear , the tonally ambiguous sections are much more frequent in Poulenc's score. Grover-Friedlander suggests that the music is motivically, rather than tonally, driven. Yet in these motives, she identifies a number of tonal references, including ""half steps or , , or , which raise expectations for tonal functioning and tonal . Poulenc's motivic, -like aesthetics does not undermine a sense of totality, but treats it as constantly deferred, or in motion."" Poulenc thereby uses tonal techniques in a more modern, tonally ambiguous harmonic language.

It is the darkest among Bernstein's ""musicals"", and one of only two for which he wrote the words and the music.

The  subsequently presented the opera on television in November 1952, a production which marked mezzo-soprano 's professional debut in the role of Dinah. Wolff later reprised the role in the 's first staging of the work in 1958. The original work is about 40 minutes long.
Bernstein was working on the opera during his honeymoon with . The story is based on the relationship of Bernstein's own parents, Sam and Jennie, but the wife's name was changed to the more singable Dinah, Bernstein's grandmother. The work is dedicated to ; Blitzstein and Bernstein were good friends, both alumni of the  in Philadelphia. Bernstein had produced one production of Blitzstein's .
The opera is frequently performed with minimal scenery (although Bernstein gave detailed instructions for drops and props) and very simple costumes. There are only two soloists, a married couple named Sam and Dinah. Their son, Junior, is often referred to but is never seen or heard. Other characters are addressed in certain scenes but also are never seen or heard: Sam's client Mr Partridge (on the telephone); his friend Bill (present and interacting with Sam but intended to be invisible); his secretary Miss Brown (present but intended to be invisible); Dinah's  (""invisible""); her  (""imaginary"").
 is the story of one day in the life of these desperately unhappy, though married people, lonely, longing for love, and unable to communicate. At the end of the opera, Sam and Dinah show a willingness to sacrifice for each other, out of commitment to the marriage, though there's not much pleasure to be had. A copyright is held for an alternate ending by Bernstein, which has not been released.


Prelude – A smiling jazz trio sings of perfect life in an affluent, unnamed suburban town, with its little white houses and happy, loving families (""Mornin' Sun""). The town could be anywhere; many names (such as  and ) are mentioned.
Scene I – Real life in suburbia contrasts greatly with what the Trio has painted. Sam and Dinah are having breakfast, alternating between habitual bickering and lyrical moments of longing for kindness. Dinah is angry with Sam. She accuses him of having an affair with his secretary, which he denies. She also reminds Sam that their son Junior's play is that afternoon, but Sam insists that his handball tournament at the gym is more important, to which she retorts, ""To hell with the gym"". She needs more money to pay for her analyst, who Sam calls an ""out-and-out fake"". Dinah says Sam should go too, which suggestion Sam pays no attention to. They agree that this is not the way to live, and they will have a conversation about their relationship problems in the evening. They both ask each other for kindness, ask the other for help ""to love you again"" and pray that the wall built up between them can be broken down. They continue to argue until Sam leaves for the office, late for his train.
Scene II – Sam, at work, exuding confidence, is dealing with business on the telephone. On the phone, he turns down entreaties from Mr. Partridge, presumably for a loan. The chorus calls him a genius and a ""marvelous man"".
Then comes a call from ""Bill"", who he is glad to lend money to: ""You'll return it whenever you want to... Is it sufficient?"" Coincidentally, Bill is also participating in the handball tournament with Sam. The chorus observes that ""When it comes to the giving, no one touches big-hearted Sam"".
Scene III – In her analyst's office, Dinah recalls a dream about finding an imaginary garden amid a ""black and bare"" landscape, and sings about the image longingly.
Meanwhile, at Sam's office, he asks his secretary if he ever made a pass at her. When reminded of an incident, he insists, in a menacing way, that it was an accident and that she should forget that it ever happened.
Scene IV – Sam and Dinah accidentally run into each other on the street. Rather than having lunch with each other, they both make up lies about imaginary commitments to lunch with others. They continue to sing on the stage (though not to each other), reflecting on the confusing and painful course their relationship has taken, and yearn for their lost happiness.
Interlude – Inside the house, the Trio sings of lovely life in Suburbia, detailing the possessions that contribute to the .
Scene V – At the gym, Sam has just won the handball tournament. He sings triumphantly that ""There's a law about men"" — how some try with all their might to rise to the top, but will never win; while others, like him, are born winners and will always succeed. ""Men are created unequal.""
Scene VI – In a hat shop, Dinah tells an unidentified person about a South Sea romance movie called ""Trouble in Tahiti"", which she has just spent the afternoon watching. (Later, we learn that she has missed Junior's play.) At first she dismisses the movie as Technicolor drivel. But as she recounts the story and its theme song ""Island Magic"", backed by the Trio, she gets caught up in the escapist fantasy of love. Suddenly self-conscious, she stops herself, as she has to prepare dinner for Sam.
Scene VII – About to enter his home, Sam sings of another law of men — that even the winner must pay ""through the nose"" for what he gets.
The Trio sings of imaginary evenings of domestic bliss in Suburbia: ""bringing the loved ones together, safe by the warmth of the firelight"". After dinner, Dinah is knitting and Sam is reading the paper. Sam decides the time has come for their talk, and Dinah, after asking what he wants to talk about, agrees: ""anything you say"". Yet Sam can't talk; he doesn't know where to begin. He blames Dinah for interruptions, but she has not said anything. ""It's no use"", he says. In the only  in the opera, Sam asks Dinah about Junior's play, and she admits she didn't go either. He suggests they go to the movies, to see a new film about Tahiti; Dinah consents. (""Sure, why not? Anything."") As they leave, they each long for quiet and communion, wondering if it's possible to rediscover their love for one another. For now, they opt for the ""bought-and-paid-for magic"" of the silver screen. The Trio makes its final ironic comment, reprising the movie's ""Island Magic"" theme song.

"The Unicorn, the Gorgon, and the Manticore",,"October 19, 1956","Library of Congress, Washington D.C.",English,1956,," is a ""madrigal fable"" for chorus, ten dancers and nine instruments with music and original  by . Based on the 16th-century Italian  genre, it consists of a prologue and 12 madrigals which tell a continuous story, interspersed with six musical interludes. The , , and  in the title are allegories for three stages in the life of the story's protagonist, a strange poet who keeps the mythical creatures as pets. The work premiered in  at the  Coolidge Auditorium on October 19, 1956.
 was commissioned in 1956 by the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Foundation for the 12th Festival of Chamber Music in   In constructing the libretto Menotti returned to an earlier script he had written after  reading 's 1954 , a translation of a medieval Latin . The plot is a comic but ultimately melancholy attack on the ""indifferent killers of the poet's dreams"": slavish social conformity and the ease with which the ""unfashionable"" is discarded. More than one writer, including Menotti himself, has suggested that he strongly identified with the poet in his story. The three creatures of the title are allegorical representations of stages in the poet's life, with  representing the beauty and promise of youth,  representing the success and haughtiness of middle age, and  representing the shy loneliness of old age. Despite its English language libretto, Menotti's work was modelled on the 16th-century Italian  or , a precursor to the  genre and typified by 's . Unlike conventional operas, all the singing is choral with no solo voice roles. Although the dancers were intended to be an integral part of the work, Menotti resisted calling it a  and eventually settled on the description ""madrigal fable"". He composed it at virtually the last minute, sending madrigals to his choreographer as he finished them. The twelfth and last one was completed a week before the premiere with the first complete rehearsal held only four days before the opening night. 
The world premiere took place at the Library of Congress  conducted by  (a last minute replacement for ) and ran on October 19, 20 and 21, 1956 to both critical and popular success. Its New York premiere was performed by the  on January 15, 1957, in a production conducted by Thomas Schippers and choreographed by John Butler who also choreographed the world premiere in Washington. The role of The Poet in the New York City production was danced by  with the three mythical creatures in the story danced by  (The Unicorn), Eugene Tanner (The Gorgon), and Richard Thomas (The Manticore). It has been revived many times over the ensuing 40 years, both in its full ballet form and (more frequently) as a choral work. It received its  premiere in 1972 performed by the , who revived it again in 1996 with a performance at  in preparation for their studio recording released the following year. Recent performances have included those in  performed by  and the Sierra Nevada Ballet in 2007;  at the  also in 2007; and Washington, D.C. performed by the Cantate Chamber Singers and the Bowen McCauley Dance troupe in 2009. Menotti's centenary year, 2011, has seen performances in  by The Esoterics vocal ensemble and in  by the Slovenian National Theatre Opera and Ballet.
 consists of a prologue and 12 madrigals which tell a continuous story. They are sung (most of them ) by a 24-voice  chorus and are interspersed with six musical interludes. Lasting approximately 45 minutes, the work is orchestrated for a  consisting of winds (, , , , ), lower strings ( and ), , and . The music was described by the  critic who attended the world premiere as ""a singular and engaging combination of ancient contrapuntal harmonies and tart, modern, dramatic values."" The critic also singled out the melancholy beauty of the twelfth and last madrigal with the chorus singing ""almost liturgically, as if each voice were a pipe in an organ."" Menotti said of the twelfth madrigal: ""It is the most deeply and personally felt of anything I've written. It is something I would like for my own funeral."" The madrigal was also sung in 1981 at the funeral of , who had been Menotti's lover for many years.
The prologue describes a strange man living in a castle above a seaside town who shuns the town's social life and the 's parties and refuses to go to church on Sundays. The strange man is a poet who on three successive Sundays takes a different pet on a walk through the streets of the town. On the first Sunday, he parades his . The Contessa insists she must have a unicorn as well and persuades her husband to get one for her. The citizens of the town then buy unicorns as well. On the next Sunday, the poet is seen with a . The Contessa and townspeople assume he has killed his unicorn and promptly kill theirs to replace them with gorgons. On the third Sunday, he appears with a . They once again follow suit by killing their gorgons and buying manticores. When the poet fails to appear on the fourth Sunday, the townspeople assume he has killed his manticore too. Scandalized, they march to his castle to attack him. When they arrive, they find the poet dying surrounded by his three pets, all of whom are alive. In the twelfth and final madrigal he berates the townspeople for slavishly following fashion. Unlike them, he had kept all his pets: ""You, not I, are the indifferent killers of the poet's dreams. How could I destroy the pain wrought children of my fancy?"" The poet then bids farewell to each of his creatures in turn and tells them ""Not even death I fear as in your arms I die.""

Taras Bulba,Mykola Lysenko,1955,Kiev Opera House,,1955,Mykhailo Starytsky," is an  in four acts  by the  . The  was written for Lysenko by his cousin , and is based on 's  . The story was about a  who discovers his son has betrayed their own people, and kills him.
The opera, which was unrevised at the time of the composer's death in 1912, was first performed in 1924. Present-day performances are however based on revised versions of the opera carried out during the 1930s and 1950s, all of which altered the text, music and .
The   worked on his   from 1880 to 1891. He insisted that all performances of the work should be sung in , which prevented any productions during his lifetime. Intent on elevating Ukrainian culture to a level commensurate with European standards, he refused to allow the opera to be translated. Lysenko maintained the opera might be too ambitious for Ukrainian , but it was eventually performed for the first time in Moscow during the , after being  by the  Ukrainian composer .
Lysenko was reputedly a descendant of the 17th century  leader Vovgura Lys, so 's story may have had a special significance for him. Shortly after completing it he played the  to , who reportedly ""listened to the whole opera with rapt attention, from time to time voicing approval and admiration. He particularly liked the passages in which national, Ukrainian, touches were most vivid... Tchaikovsky embraced Lysenko and congratulated him on his talented composition.""
The history of the present form of  is complex. A piano score was published in 1913, but much of Lysenko's original orchestration has been lost. The prelude to the fourth act was first given at a concert in Kyiv in 1914, when the performance was conducted by the Russian composer . The first performance of the full opera took place in 1924 in . Although this performance was a failure, others were more successful, and further productions took place in Kyiv in  1927, and in  in 1930. These performances led to the work being revised in 1937 before being performed in Moscow—the libretto was revised by the Ukrainian poet , and Lysenko's pupil Revutsky and the Ukrainian composer  collaborated to revise the orchestration. This new version of the opera was criticized for departing too far from Lysenko's original intentions. It was not until after World War II that Rylsky, Revutsky, and Lyatoshynsky reworked the opera once more, producing the version of the work that is nowadays performed, and which was premiered in Kiev in 1955. The opera is part of the  of the , based in Kyiv, which also performed it at the  in Germany in 1982, 's  in 1987, and in  the following year. The National Opera of Ukraine has traditionally performed the opera at the end of each operatic season in Kyiv.
The work's perceived structural defects may to a large extent be because Lysenko was never able to adjust the work after hearing it being performed. The opera marks a great advance on the composer's earlier works, such as  and . Its  and  elements, which are more closely integrated in a continuous musical framework, show that Lysenko was influenced by Tchaikovsky. 
Problematic issues relating to the opera include: the episodic nature of the libretto; dances. patriotic marches and choruses, which have no connection with the plot; a long scene in the third act, when Kudryiaha is chosen to lead the Cossacks, but then does not reappear; the compression of the historical events that the opera is based on into a single scene; and the lack of emotional or musical transition from the death of an important character to the triumphant (and unsung) final scene.
Amongst those who have sung the role of Taras is the Ukrainian singer , who also featured in a recording of the opera.
 is set in Kyiv, Taras's village in Ukraine, the , and , in the 17th century, at a time when Poland sought supremacy in the region. This synopsis is based on the version which was first produced in 1955. The opera is preceded by an orchestral overture.
The opera opens in Kyiv, which is occupied by the Polish , whose servants disperse a crowd listening to the song of a , or Ukrainian bard. Taras Bulba leaves his sons Ostap and Andriy at a  to be educated. Andriy has already been impressed by a Polish girl he has seen (who turns out to be Maryltsya, daughter of the Polish governor of Dubno). Ostap encourages the kobzar to sing a patriotic song; this angers the Poles, and in a scuffle the bard is killed.
Taras's village. Ostap and Andriy return from Kiev and greet their mother Nastya. Bulba's friend Tovkach tells of the war being unleashed throughout Ukraine by the Poles. Despite his wife's protestations, Taras determines to take his sons to the Sich, the  stronghold, so as to participate in the struggles. Nastya collapses.
The Sich. Taras successfully encourages the idle residents to rouse themselves for battle. Andriy and Ostap look forward to this; when Andriy has brief forebodings, Ostap promises always to support him. Drumbeats summon a council () of the Cossacks; with Taras's support, they elect a new, more pugnacious , Kyrdiaha, to lead them. He declares his intention to go into battle.
The Cossack camp. The Cossacks are besieging Dubno, where Maryltsya's father is governor. She has sent her  maid to find Andriy, and to beg his help as the inhabitants are suffering from starvation. Andriy agrees to help and, with the maid, takes food into the town through a secret passage.
Inside the castle. Andriy and Maryltsya express their love for each other. Andriy asks the Governor for her hand; the szlachta object on class grounds.  On the advice of his priest, the Governor considers it expedient to allow Andriy to marry, and appoints him a Colonel in the Polish Army.
The Cossack camp. Taras hears news that the Tatars have destroyed the Sich. Then an escaping prisoner tells him of Andriy's desertion. Troops under Andriy make a  from the castle, and Taras kills his own son for his treason. Ostap's feelings are torn and he sings a lament for his brother.
In a purely orchestral scene Taras and Ostap lead the Cossacks to victory against the Poles and take over the town of Dubno.
This ending significantly differs from Gogol's original in which first Ostap and then Taras are captured by the Poles and given cruel public executions. Many other significant features of the novel - notably the equivocal behaviour of Taras and the Cossacks to local  - are also omitted (see article ).

At the first performance,  was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Florida State.
It has been speculated that the opera was inspired by , and threat of institutional Hollywood communist invasion of America during the early 1950s. The opera also contains many  themes that had not been widely explored in popular culture at the time of the opera's writing. Floyd said this opera was meant to be different from a traditional opera.
The music is largely characterized by  folk melodies. Also included are some Protestant hymns and some traditional classical music. A particularly prominent part of the opera is Susannah's soaring and melancholy aria in Act II, ""The Trees on the Mountain"", which is similar to Appalachian folk tunes but in fact Floyd's own composition. In 2019,  released a vernacular version of ""Trees on the Mountains"" on her album, 
Written during the McCarthy era,  is based loosely on the Apocryphal tale of Susannah and the Elders. In New Hope Valley, Tennessee, Susannah – a pretty and well-mannered young woman of humble origins – is faced with hostility from her church community. The opera opens at a square dance given by her church; a group of wives, jealous of Susannah's beauty and the attention it brings from their husbands, are gossiping about her. Mrs. McLean, one of the wives, states that you can't expect more from someone who was raised by her drunken brother, Sam. Finally, the Reverend Olin Blitch, newly arrived to lead the congregation, enters and asks Susannah to dance despite the gossip. Later that evening, Susannah tells her admirer Little Bat – son of Mrs. McLean and her husband, an elder of the church – about the dance; Little Bat leaves abruptly once her brother Sam returns from hunting.
The next morning Susannah is innocently bathing naked in the creek near her home; she is discovered by the elders, who are searching for a baptismal stream. They conceal their lust with outrage and tell the community of her wickedness. Susannah arrives at a church dinner that evening and is sent away, much to her confusion. Later, as she is pondering why she has been shunned, Little Bat tells her that the elders have denounced her for bathing in the nude, and admits that he was coerced into saying she seduced him.
Sam informs Susannah that she must make a public confession in order to be absolved. Though she claims she has nothing to confess, she goes to the service where Olin Blitch is preaching. When she is singled out to come forward, she runs away. Once the service has ended, Reverend Blitch goes to Susannah's house and offers to pray for her soul. Upon discovering that her brother is away, Blitch rapes her.
The next day Blitch, having discovered that Susannah was a virgin, comes to her and begs for forgiveness. He throws himself at Susannah's mercy, but she refuses to forgive him. Blitch preaches a sermon to the congregation, in which he claims that God revealed to him in a vision that Susannah has been judged unjustly, but the congregation doesn't believe him.  When Susannah tells Sam the story, he threatens to kill Blitch and leaves for the baptismal service carrying his shotgun.  He shoots Blitch. Convinced that Susannah led her brother to murder, the community heads to her house to drive her out of the valley. However, Little Bat has warned her in advance, and when the vigilantes arrive she is waiting with a shotgun. They retreat, but she has effectively severed her ties with the community and her world.

Ifigenia and her mother, Clitennestra were invited by Agamennone, believing that they were preparing for marriage ceremony between her and Achille.

Krenek, an Austrian who was in Switzerland at the time of the , escaped to exile in the USA and a teaching position at , where Lavery (1902–86) was a newspaper editor in neighboring  (he would later run for Congress and write for Hollywood). The piece was designed for college workshops and used six instruments (violin, clarinet, trumpet, percussion and two pianos) but the  music still proved beyond the reach of potential performers; only two scenes were given at Vassar on 13 May 1941.

He is brought back to God only after tragedy has engulfed them both.
Stewart is harsh in his assessment of the text (""It would be charitable to suppose that Krenek was not yet sufficiently acquainted with English to appreciate the awfulness of such lines"") and Krenek may have been embarrassed for another reason, later writing: ""It fitted in well to the line of religiously flavored political thinking that I had developed.""

For , Menotti won the 1950  and also the 1950  award for Best Musical.

The political dissident John Sorel is on the run from the secret police. At his home, his wife Magda and his mother hide him. The police arrive and search, but cannot find him. John says that he will escape to the border, and tells Magda to go to the consul and apply for a visa to leave the country. He will wait to cross the border until his wife, mother and child are safe.

Many people are waiting to obtain visas. Magda applies and joins the crowd, but the secretary cannot promise anything. Much specific paperwork is needed, and obtaining a visa is a long process. The same people wait at the consul's office day after day without approval of a visa.

The child is ill, and John's mother sings to comfort the child. The police try to extract information from Magda on her husband's compatriots, but she refuses. A message then arrives from John urging Magda to hurry with the visa.

Magda is desperate to see the consul. A magician, waiting for a visa, attempts to impress the secretary by performing magic tricks and hypnotizing the rest of the room into believing they are at a ball, but he only ends up frightening her. Magda, after repeated visits, erupts in an anguished rant at the secretary, who says that she may see the consul once an ""important visitor"" has finished his business. This visitor proves to be the chief of police and Magda flees in terror.

Magda's child and mother-in-law have died. At the consul's office, Magda learns that John is planning to risk his life and return for her. A wealthy woman arrives and is immediately given a visa. Magda thinks of suicide to try to protect John, and leaves the consulate. As the office is about to shut down for the day, John suddenly arrives, but with the police in pursuit. The police capture John, and the secretary gets on the phone to try to contact Magda.

Despondent, and with visions of her past crowding her mind, Magda turns on the gas in the oven to kill herself. Her telephone then rings, the secretary trying in vain to contact her.

The Civil War is over. The citizens of Columbia, South Carolina, lament the sorrow and horror of the war. Colonel Jonathan Wade, with his aide, Lieutenant Patrick, leads the Northern troops of occupation into Columbia and greets Judge Townsend with kindness, but the Judge's daughter, Celia, scorns Jonathan.
The judge invites Jonathan to his home and describes the residence's beauty before the war and its mistreatment by Sherman's troops. The maid, Nicey, deems Jonathan a good man, but Celia denounces him for not understanding the depth of Southern suffering. Jonathan bitterly reveals his own losses from the war, and the two young people begin to understand one another.
Northern pardon brokers selling citizenship to ex-Confederates arouse the indignation of Judge Townsend. Lucas Wardlaw, a hotheaded Southerner, expresses the resentment for Northern reformers. With the arrival of Enoch Pratt, chief of the Freedmen's Bureau, tensions erupt. An evening party at the Townsends' home disintegrates as the Southern citizens furiously refuse to submit to the Northern reforms preached by a fervent Pratt.

Several months later, during a confrontation with Jonathan, Lucas demands back his old way of life, the way of privilege and slavery. Enoch Pratt insists that Judge Townsend be removed from the bench and that the Radical Republicans should use reform as a means of securing future political power. Jonathan sees the shortcomings of all the extremists' demands.
Celia confesses her love for Jonathan, but Lucas taunts the couple with hints of vigilante reprisals. Jonathan's appeal to higher authority to spare Judge Townsend is denied, and he undergoes an agony of conscience. He announces to the Townsends the Judge's dismissal. Judge Townsend rages violently against Jonathan; Celia, though torn between her love for Jonathan and her father, accepts Jonathan's offer of marriage. Her father renounces her.
At the wedding, Nicey sings a spiritual about the wedding feast at Canaan. The Guardian Knights of White Men's Rights harass Nicey and her friends, but Nicey bravely faces them down. Jonathan and Celia try to shelter themselves from the world with their love.

Jonathan's attempts to remain impartial have only angered both Northerners and Southerners. Pratt accuses Celia of influencing the Colonel and enlists Lieutenant Patrick in a plot to destroy Jonathan. Judge Bell, Judge Townsend's replacement, resigns in disgust at the political corruption, and Jonathan loses his last ally.
Pratt tries to provoke Jonathan into insubordination and court-martial, and an order arrives commanding Jonathan to confiscate all of Judge Townsend's possessions. Celia and Jonathan react in anger, fear, and confusion; they yearn for another time and another place where they might find peace. Jonathan decides to desert. Townsend publicly denounces the North, and Jonathan and Celia discover that Lieutenant Patrick has carried out the order of confiscation. Sensing a trap, they plan to escape the country. Suddenly, Jonathan's guards capture three Guardian Knights, Lucas among them, about to burn a torch on Wade's lawn.
In the middle of the night, the full contingent of Guardian Knights arrive to free Lucas, while Union soldiers, led by Pratt and Patrick, also surround the house before attempting to arrest Jonathan for insubordination. Shots are fired, and Jonathan is killed; both sides begin to blame each other. Kneeling by Jonathan's side, Celia silences them, accusing both sides of the murder of a good and decent man. Nicey prays that God accept Jonathan into heaven.

In 2014 the work was revived by , with a reduced  by , the first performance of this version being given at the  at the  on 13 February 2014.
As epigraph to the score Tippett placed the German words ""Es möge uns das Schicksal gönnen, dass wir das innere Ohr von dem Munde der Seele nicht abwenden,"" or, ""May Fate grant that we never turn our inner ear away from our soul's lips."" These words conclude a 1912 essay on the paintings of  by .
 takes a private view of the events of the , focusing on individual moments of moral choice. The opera begins soon after the birth of Paris, when an Old Man prophesies that the baby will grow up to cause his father's death. Queen Hecuba immediately declares that her child must be killed. Priam hesitates, but reflects, ""What means one life when the choice involves a whole city?"" and gives the baby to the Young Man to be abandoned on a mountainside.
Left alone, the Old Man, the Young Man, and the child's Nurse discuss Priam's choice. These three characters will return throughout the opera to comment on the action from their differing perspectives. Sensing Priam's true feelings the Young Man does not kill the baby, but gives him to shepherds to raise as their own.
Years later, Priam is hunting on the mountain with his eldest son, Hector. Hector attempts to subdue a wild bull, but a strange child leaps onto its back and rides away. The child returns, asks to join Hector among the heroes of Troy, and says his name is Paris. Priam is filled with joy that his secret wish was fulfilled, and he welcomes Paris back to Troy as its prince, whatever the consequences may be. The Nurse and the Old and Young Man observe this reversal with foreboding, but are interrupted by revellers at the wedding of Hector and Andromache. The guests gossip that Hector and Paris never became friendly, and that Paris has left Troy for the court of Menelaus in Sparta.
In Sparta, Paris and Helen have already become lovers. Paris wonders if there is any choice in life at all - he feels pulled irresistibly toward Helen by a force greater than himself. As if in answer to his question, the god Hermes appears, and instructs him to choose between three goddesses: Athene, Hera, and Aphrodite, whose roles are sung by Hecuba, Andromache, and Helen. Athene/Hecuba offers Paris glory in war, Hera/Andromache offers domestic peace, but Aphrodite/Helen simply says his name, and he responds with hers, his choice made unconsciously. The other two goddesses curse him, foretelling the doom he will bring to Troy.
Troy is under siege. In the city, Hector taunts Paris with cowardice for having run away from Menelaus in battle. Scolded by Priam, the brothers return to the fight together. The Old Man, fearful for Troy, calls on Hermes and asks to be shown Achilles, hero of the Greeks.
Achilles has withdrawn from battle, and the scene in his tent is a peaceful one, as he sings to his friend Patroclus a lyrical song of their home, ""O rich soiled land,"" accompanied by solo guitar. But Patroclus is ashamed that Achilles will not fight, and asks to be allowed to go into battle wearing Achilles' armor, so that the Greeks will take hope from the sight of their greatest warrior. Achilles agrees, and offers a libation to the gods for Patroclus' safety.
Watching invisibly under the protection of Hermes, the Old Man begs the god to warn Priam of the danger, but in Troy, Paris is already announcing to the king that Hector has slain Patroclus in single combat. The father and sons sing a trio of thanks for the victory, but they are interrupted by the chilling sound of Achilles' war-cry, taken up and echoed by the Greek army. Greece's greatest warrior has returned to the field in a berserk fury.
In Hector's bedchamber, Andromache sits and waits for her husband. She remembers with terror the day Achilles killed her father and brothers. Queen Hecuba enters and tells her to save Hector by going to the walls of Troy and calling him out of battle. Andromache refuses, asking why Priam will not end the war by returning the stolen Helen to her own husband. Hecuba scoffs that no war was fought for a woman: Helen may be the pretext, but the great city of Troy is the Greek's real prize. Helen herself now enters, and Andromache relieves her feelings with a volley of insults. Helen responds with a virtuoso aria claiming that erotic passion is greater than either morality or politics, that her love ""touches Heaven, because it stretches down to Hell."" Finding no comfort in sisterhood, the three women make separate prayers, each to the goddess she represented in the first act.
Helen and Hecuba go, and a serving-woman enters to ask if she should light the fire for Hector's evening bath. Denying her instinctive knowledge of his death, Andromache answers ""Yes...yes,"" but her slave mockingly echoes ""No...no,"" as the servants are first to hear all the bad news. Andromache runs out in despair, and the serving-woman is joined by a chorus of slaves who comment cynically: ""We could tell the story too, the pathetic story of our masters, viewed from the corridor.""
Paris brings King Priam the news of Hector's death. Priam curses his surviving son, wishing him dead as well, and Paris goes, swearing not to return until he has killed Achilles in revenge. Alone, Priam weeps that the Old Man years ago spoke only of his own death, not of Hector's. The Old Man, the Young Man, and the Nurse appear and question the king: ""One son to live by another's death, is that the law of life you favour?"" Priam weakly tries to answer ""Yes...yes,"" but an unseen chorus replies ""No...no"": his heart's answer.
Hermes guides Priam to Achilles' tent. In a quiet scene, Priam kisses Achilles' hands, ""the hands of him who slew my son"" and begs to be given Hector's body for burial. Achilles agrees, and the two look ahead to their own deaths: Achilles to be killed by Paris, and Priam to be killed by Neoptolemus, Achilles' son.
Troy is in ruins. Priam refuses to leave his city, and one by one his family leaves him. His last farewell is with Helen, to whom he speaks gently. There is a moment of stillness before Achilles' son appears to strike the killing blow and Hermes, the drama over, departs for Olympus.

Atlántida," by , Manuel de Falla",18 June 1962,"Teatro alla Scala, Milan",Catalan,1962,," () is an  (titled a 'cantata escénica') in a prologue and three parts, by , based on the Catalan poem  by . Falla worked on the score for twenty years but had not completed it at his death in Argentina in 1946; his disciple  prepared the score for performance.
Verdaguer brought together pre-history and history: a child (Christopher Columbus) is the sole survivor of a shipwreck of a Genoese boat off the Spanish coast. After reaching shore, he is adopted by a hermit who recounts the history of the earth and seas. He begins the legend with Alcide (Hercules) arriving from Greece to attack the Atlanteans reaching the Spanish side of the Pyrenees. He finds a huge fire started by Geryon, a three-headed African monster. King Tubal of the Pyrenees is killed and his daughter Pyrene gives her father to Alcide imploring him to set forth to kill the monster, before dying. Alcide decides to make a port where a white barque (barca) had landed. After arriving in Cadiz from Barcelona, Alcide goes to the Hesperides, finding the orange tree, Atlas's widow and three daughters, and kills the dragon wrapped on the tree defending the entry to the continent. The Hesperides die (ascending to the heavens as the Pleiades) and Alcide returns to Cadiz; he kills Geryon and sees the waters break over Mount Calpe and rush over Atlantis. Still accompanied by the hermit, the adult Columbus dreams of unlocking the mystery of Atlantis and appeals to Queen Isabella of Spain who gives him jewels to pay for his venture. The old man bids Columbus to fly.
 started in 1926 as a , but grew over 20 years to become a full opera. The poem suited him as he responded fully to its blend of mythology and primitive Iberia, and the setting of Cadiz, his home city. He visited many of the sites referred to in the epic: , , the temple of Hercules, ,  and its .
Falla died in Argentina before he finished the work, leaving a loose collection of sketches. The long work of editing and completion was undertaken by Ernesto Halffter. The music shows the influence of classical models from Spanish polyphony, 17th century monody, and of 16th century or earlier choral writing.
It is not a true opera, more a stage cantata, where the chorus takes a principal role, interrupted by Coryphaeus as the narrator. Sometimes this narration of the action is depicted on the stage by the appropriate characters (some singers, some – Hercules and Columbus – actors).
When finally completed, large extracts were performed in a concert version at the , Barcelona in November 1961, conducted by , with  as Isabella, and in Cadiz. The following June it was presented in a staged production at , Milan, in Italian, under the baton of  with ,  and  and produced by , (according to the  reviewer this performance took three hours.)  then in Berlin and Buenos Aires, and America conducted by . The score was withdrawn by Halffter after this while he made further revisions; a shorter version was heard in concert form in Lucerne in 1976 and a longer definitive version heard at the Granada Festival the following year prior to a studio recording at the .
The opera has three major singing roles: the narrator Corifeo (), an old man who tells  of the sinking of , Queen  (), and  (), then minor roles such as the three-headed  (three tenors).
In the first part, Christopher Columbus, as a boy, is shipwrecked on an island. To console him an Old Man tells him the legend of Atlantis, the fabled land wiped out by Hercules and submerged at the bottom of the sea off the coast of Spain. To the spot — the Pillars of Hercules — Columbus, now a grown man, comes and dreams of crossing the ocean. Isabella of Spain provides him with the means and he discovers the New World and claims it for Christendom. The work is both an epic of Catholic Spain and its mission in the world, but treated with poetic dignity and classical restraint.
A live recording of the 1962 stage premiere at La Scala in Milan was issued by Memories HR on two CDs in 1993.

In November 1967 the production was also given, still with , on tour at the  in .  Ginastera prepared from the opera a concert work for soprano and orchestra, which received its own first performance in October 1964.
Malena Kuss has published a detailed study of Ginastera's use of motives and of Argentine musical idioms in the opera.  Pola Suares Urtubey has published an analysis of the dramatic structure of the opera.
The setting is  in the 8th century.  A note is that Don Rodrigo is also the  name for , the last  king of .  The three acts of the opera are divided into nine scenes linked by interludes, with labeling of the scenes as follows:



The scenes mirror each other in a format resembling a dramatic palindrome, with Scene 1 mirrored in Scene 9, Scene 2 mirrored in Scene 8, and so on, with Scene 5 forming the dramatic climax and fulcrum of the story.
At the start, Don Rodrigo has avenged an attack on his father.  He is then about to be crowned King of Spain.  Don Julian, Governor of Ceuta in Africa, introduces the King to his daughter Florinda.  Rodrigo promises Don Julian that he will look after her as a daughter if she is permitted to stay at the royal court.  At the coronation of Rodrigo, Florinda drops the crown.  Although some regard this accident as a baleful sign, Rodrigo then retrieves the crown and places it on his own head.  Historically, a chest in the Vault of Hercules has contained a locked mystery, which every King of Spain has respected since ancient times.  However, Rodrigo opens the locked chest, where he sees the secret in the form of an Arab flag and a curse.  The curse states that he who has opened the chest will be the last of his dynasty and that the Arabs will enslave Spain.
Later, Florinda bathes in a fountain, which Rodrigo sees.  He goes to Florinda’s bedroom at night, and forces himself on her.  Rodrigo then abandons her.  Florinda writes to her father, angrily calling for revenge on Rodrigo.
Don Julian raises a rebellion against Don Rodrigo.  At the battle at Guadalete, Don Julian is victorious against Don Rodrigo, which allows the Moors to enter Spain, fulfilling that part of the curse.  Rodrigo becomes a penniless vagrant, and eventually finds shelter with a blind hermit.  Florinda eventually discovers Rodrigo there.  Rodrigo confesses his sins, and finally dies in Florinda's embrace.

Curlew River,Benjamin Britten,13 June 1964,"Church of St Bartholomew, Orford, Suffolk",,1964,William Plomer," (Op. 71) is an English music drama, with music by  to a libretto by .  The first of Britten's three 'Parables for Church Performance', the work is based on the Japanese  play  (Sumida River) of Juro Motomasa] (1395–1431), which Britten saw during a visit to Japan and the Far East in early 1956. Beyond the  source dramatic material, Britten incorporated elements of  treatment of theatrical time into this composition.  marked a departure in style for the remainder of the composer's creative life, paving the way for such works as ,  and the .
Plomer translated the setting of the original into a Christian , set in early medieval times near the fictional Curlew River, in the  of . Peter F. Alexander has investigated in detail the librettist's contribution to the work, through study of the letters between Plomer and Britten. Mikiko Ishi has done a comparative study of the 'weeping mother' figures in , , and various religious plays from medieval Europe. Daniel Albright has examined Britten's and Plomer's adaptations of aspects of the  original into the context of their own cultural and religious backgrounds in the creation of .
Under 's direction, the work was premiered on 13 June 1964 at , , England, by the . The original cast included Britten regulars  and . The United States premiere was presented at the  on 26 June 1966, with  as the Madwoman.
 opens, as do the other two Church Parables, with a , to the hymn  (), in which all performers, including the musicians, walk to the performance area and take their places. At a cue from the organ, the Abbot, who acts as a narrator, introduces the ""mystery"" to be presented. The monks who depict the principal players don their costumes to stately instrumental accompaniment after which the play commences.
The Ferryman sings of a memorial service that will be held that day at a shrine across the river. A Traveller approaches, wishing to cross the Curlew River. The Ferryman delays his departure when they hear the Madwoman approaching. She has gone mad because of grief for her son, who disappeared a year ago. Though the Ferryman is initially reluctant to carry the Madwoman, the other characters take pity on her and persuade him to give her passage. As they cross the river, the Ferryman tells the story of the shrine: it is the burial place of a boy who arrived the year before with a cruel master who had kidnapped him from his home near the Black Mountains. The boy was sick, and his master abandoned him by the river. Despite being cared for by the locals, the boy died. The Ferryman recounts the boy's words:
The river people believe that the boy's grave is sacred, that:
As the Ferryman tells his story, it becomes clear that the boy he describes is the child of the Madwoman. Grief-stricken, she joins the rest of the cast in praying at the boy's graveside. At the climactic moment when all the men are chanting together, the voice of the boy (a treble) is heard echoing them, and his spirit appears above the tomb to reassure his mother:
At this point, the Madwoman is redeemed and her madness lifts. Britten depicts the moment with the Madwoman letting out a joyful, melismatic ""Amen"", the final note of which resolves onto a long-delayed unison with the full cast – a signal of return and acceptance.
Here the robing ceremony music returns, as at the start, and the players resume their normal dress. The Abbot reiterates the moral, and bids the audience farewell. The full cast then recess to the same plainsong with which the work began.
At the premiere performance the instrumentalists included flutist , horn player , violist , double bass player , harpist , organist  and percussionist .
The singers are accompanied by a small group of instrumentalists, dressed as lay brothers. The work is scored for:
Unusually, there is no conductor in the work—instead, the instrumental performers lead among themselves; the places at which each instrument is to lead are marked in the score. The lack of a conductor allows Britten to dispense with a universal tempo, the performers often instead playing in two or more separate groups at separate tempi, comparable to the sound of the music of a Nobayashi ensemble in Noh plays. This leads to another unusual notational device, the 'Curlew sign', which is used to 'resynchronise' previously separate groups of musicians by instructing one to sustain or repeat notes 'ad lib' until a given point has been reached in the music of another group. The harp part is heavily influenced by music for the koto and the chamber organ part features extensive use of , which are derived from the , an ancient Japanese free-reed mouth organ used in  court music. (Britten had become acquainted with this instrument while in Japan for two weeks in February 1956.)
Britten's chief compositional technique in  is , which he uses to extraordinary dramatic effect. It permeates all aspects of the work's composition, with textures derived from short, decorative couplings, or long, unsynchronised layers of melody. The opening plainsong ('Te lucis ante terminum') suggests many of the melodic shapes throughout the Parable.
As in many of Britten's other dramatic works, individual instruments are used to symbolise particular characters. In , the flute and horn are used most clearly for this purpose, symbolising the Madwoman and Ferryman respectively. With such a small orchestra, Britten does not use the 'sound worlds' that are clearly demonstrated in his  and , nor the dramatic change in orchestral timbre (with the entry of the celesta and vibraphone, respectively) that accompanies the appearances of Quint in  or Tadzio in .
The composer and Viola Tunnard supervised the first commercial recording of the work, for Decca (Decca SET 301), with the following singers:

Alexandre bis,Bohuslav Martinů,18 February 1964,Nationaltheater Mannheim,French,1964,André Wurmser,"  ( in ;  in ) is a   in one act by , ( 255), composed in 1937 to an original  written in  by André Wurmser.  
The opera was intended by Martinů, who was then living in Paris, for performance at the . However, various delays (including the intervening ) prevented its performance during the composer's lifetime.
The opera's first performance was given at the  on 18 February 1964, when it was conducted by Georg Calder. Shortly afterwards it was given its first performance in Martinů's native  by the Brno Janáček Opera. 
The opera is subtitled 'The Tragedy of a Man who Had His Beard Cut', and the surrealist libretto is set in Paris about 1900. Although Martinů had asked Wurmser for a libretto including a singing cat, he compromised on Wurmser's suggestion of a singing portrait, which acts as narrator to a tale of bourgeois infidelity.
The opera takes place in a bourgeois salon in Paris around 1900. The maid Philomène is cleaning and complaining about her life. The husband Alexandre, bearded, asks Philomène to bring in a suitcase and secretly leaves, allegedly for the station, crossing his cousin of the same name from America. Alexander's portrait on the wall is outraged by the game of betrayal. Oscar, a man Armande had met on holiday, comes to visit her. He is dressed in sportswear and offers her a lesson in cycling. Armanda rejects his courtship, pointing out that she is polite and respectable. Oscar leaves.
The beardless Alexander-cousin arrives and explains that Alexander-husband has gone away. Armande falls in love with him at first sight and submits to him, which displeases the painting of Alexander and the maid Philomène. Armande then has dreams full of remorse. In the first dream, both Alexanders kill each other. In the second, the goddess of marriage, played by Philomène, condemns Armande and she is abducted by demons - bearded dancers. In the third, the suitor Oscar appears and dances with Armande on roller skates.
In the morning the maid Philomena cleans up in the salon and complains about her life. Alexandre-husband enters, without his beard, and says goodbye to Armande before leaving for the office. During the farewell, he discovers that his wife has also changed. After his departure Oscar enters. To his surprise, this time Armanda accepts his invitation for a cycling lesson. The portrait of the husband is left alone and expresses the 'moral' - that it is best if a husband does not tempt his wife.

The opera was translated into French () by  for the work's first (private) performance at the  in Paris on 21 October 1963, followed the next day by the public premiere. George Mead translated the work into English for the opera's American premiere at the  the following year.
The opera was originally intended for the larger Paris Opéra, and the title was changed from  to  then to its final form. Menotti returned to his own Italian language in composing the libretto, but the premiere was in French; Menotti was also the producer of the premiere production.  magazine congratulated him and the conductor for ""a beautifully thought-out and executed performance"" which was ""enormously applauded with one solitary boo-er"".
However,  was harshly ridiculed by French music critics, continuing a succession of critical failures for Menotti which began with  (1956). The French daily newspaper  went so far as to describe the work as ""A Misery"".
Despite the response from the French public, Menotti hoped that the opera would get a warmer reception at its American premiere at the  in New York City on 23 January 1964. This presentation boasted a highly elaborate set by , star billing, and was performed in English using a translation by . Conductor  led the Met cast, which included  as Abdul,  as Kitty,  as Sardula,  as Kodanda,  as Maharajah,  as Maharanee, and  as Scattergood. Though the quality of the singing was praised by critics, New York's response to the opera was negative.
Four months later, the work was first performed in the original Italian at  in  on 15 May 1964 with conductor ,  as Abdul, Helen Mané as Kitty, Maliponte as Sardula,  as Kodanda,  as Scattergood, and  as the Marajah.
Italy's reception of the La Fenice production was lukewarm and the opera was not performed again for many years. Reactions from critics internationally commented on the opera's poor libretto. At that time avant-garde music was in vogue and critics felt Menotti's conservative style of composition was overly sentimental and trite; although a few of the arias and a septet in the work were generally praised. Several critics commented that the music failed to live up to the quality of earlier Menotti operas like  (1954) and  (1950). In response to this reaction to his opera, Menotti stated:
A revised version of the opera was given by the  in 1973 with John Reardon as Abdul (repeating the role he created in Italian at La Fenice), Joanna Bruno as Kitty, Gary Glaze as Kodanda, and David Clartworthy as Mr. Scattergood. Menotti directed. Critics seemed to like this version better. The  said it was ""packed with solid, wonderful, memorable music"" and that John Reardon's performance was ""simply flawless.""
The opera was revived in 1981 at the  in honor of the composer's 70th birthday. The production was led by conductor  and starred  as Kitty. Menotti also directed a production in 1984 at the this time starring baritone Louis Otey as Abdul and conducted by the late Baldo Podic. 
It was presented as part of the 2011 festival season by the  under conductor George Manahan directed by Ned Canty, with  as Kitty,  as Abdul,  as Sardula,  as Kodanda,  as Maharajah,  as Maharanee, and  as Scattergood. Critical reception of the production was positive, with several critics calling for a re-examination of the piece.
Menotti reverts from the singing-speech of  (derived according to the composer from Monteverdi) to reviving the means of the classical Italian comic opera of  and , with recitative and aria, stanzas, and musical numbers. The score includes large ensembles where the characters stand motionless coloratura for the heroine. The  critic noted a ""charming"" solo for the 'savage' with the refrain ""Je ne suis pas jaloux"", which was vitiated by a duet immediately following in similar vein and rhythm. The second act's cocktail-party scene was described as ""clever and calculated"" and the first act ""mostly jog-trot"".
Kitty, a young student of  at , arrives in India in search of the earth's ""last savage"" – the chosen topic for her senior thesis. She is accompanied by her parents, an American millionaire and his wife, who are more interested in finding Kitty a husband than in their daughter's research. Kitty's parents attempt to entice Kitty into marrying the Marajah's son, the Crown Prince of Rajaputana, but she refuses to do so until she has found her savage. Her parents accordingly hire the peasant Abdul to pretend to be a savage for $100,000. Kitty is fooled by this ruse and accordingly captures Abdul. She plans to take Abdul back to Chicago where she intends to present him to the scientific community and put him on display in an exhibit at the New York Zoo.
On the flight back to New York, Kitty becomes quite attached to Abdul and decides to keep him for herself. In Chicago she attempts to civilize him without success and Abdul ends up ruining a cocktail party that Kitty hosts with several important guests in attendance. Abdul flees the ruined party and is not found by Kitty until several months later when she discovers him in a jungle cave. Kitty declares her love for Abdul and decides to move into the cave with him. The opera ends with the couple in each other's arms while Kitty's father's servants deliver modern appliances such as a television and a refrigerator to the cave.

Juha,,28 October 1963,"Lahti, Finland",Finnish,1963,Aino Ackté," is a three-act opera by , with a   by  based on the 1911 novel of the same name by . Although completed by 1922, it was only finally staged at the music college in  on 28 October 1963. The story is a drama of a love triangle: the older husband Juha, his young wife Marja, and her seducer the merchant Shemeikka. Set in the 1880s in Kainuu in northern Finland, the human tragedy is based around the harsh realities of a farming community and the clash of their lifestyle with the more worldly nomadic Karelians, represented by Shemeikka.
Ackté first offered the libretto to , who, after two years, declined to set it, explaining in a letter to Ackté that he believed the text should be subservient to the “absolute music” of the score, and he felt unable to achieve that with what he called Aho’s “masterpiece”.
 was Merikanto's second opera, following  in 1912. Having composed  from 1919 to 1922, Merikanto submitted it to the board of the national opera in Helsinki who were worried by its modernity. As he had no response from them, Merikanto withdrew the work and did not compose any further operas.  was written by  and premiered at the Finnish National Opera in 1935. The third act of Merikanto's version was broadcast on 4 December 1957, the year before the composer’s death, and the entire opera on 3 December 1958.
After the Lahti première on 28 October 1963,  was accepted at the  in 1967, leading to a recording for Finlandia, and a production at  in 1971, revived the following year. A later production was toured to the  in 1987. The opera has also been seen in ,  and . A new production was mounted at Helsinki Opera House in December 2011.
The music is most powerful when embodying the raw emotions of the characters: Juha's passive suffering, and his forgiveness for his wife contrasted with his wild rage when he attacks and cripples Shemeikka; Marja's love for Shemeikka and pain when he turns from her; Anja’s moving lyricism, whose love for Shemeikka is unrequited.
's terseness and ’s richness are points of reference, although the composer has a unique voice his own. One reviewer has even described the piece as “one of the great operas of the [20th] century”.
However, although there are parallels with the Janáček of  or , there is also a “high-Romantic, rhapsodic” use of the orchestra. Instrumental characterization of the cast is also used: Juha with brass and low woodwind, while Shemeikka’s sound world is bright and at times ; Marja is often accompanied by solo violin or flute. In the long third act interlude, the themes and instrumental colours of the three main protagonists are worked through sonata-form development.
Act 1 opens with Juha reflecting on how his marriage has soured; his wife Marja no longer takes any notice of him. Shemeikka, a wealthy merchant, arrives at the village and flirts with Marja, giving her a gold buckle and silk shawl, which Juha insists on paying for. Next day, while Juha has gone in his boat to fetch his mother for a visit, Shemeikka passes by again, mocking Marja’s older husband and urging her to come away with him. Unmoved at first, when her mother-in-law arrives and insults her she is spurred into joining the merchant. Kaisa, the maid, says that Marja has been taken by force.
The first scene of Act 2 is set in one of Shemeikka’s fishing cabins where Marja is excitedly awaiting his return after an absence of three weeks. Eventually Marja is told of Shemeikka’s methods – an old fisherman tells her of his robbery and extortion, and another girl at the house, Anja, explains how he finds a new girl each summer and when he is tired of her passes her on to his family as a servant. The other girls seem to have accepted this. When Shemeikka returns, drunk, Marja asks the old fisherman to take her away, but he is afraid. She reveals to Shemeikka that she is pregnant and he tells her to return to her husband – another child is nothing to him. Marja strikes him.
The next scene is at Shemeikka’s large farmstead, where Marja is rocking her baby’s cradle. She is bitter, but during a conversation with Anja sees Juha (who has come searching for Marja) outside in the yard. Marja at first wants to hide from him, but then decides to leave, but Shemeikka’s mother stops her – the child must stay. Shemeikka comes in with a new summer girl from Russia, and dances ensue. Marja confronts Shemeikka then rushes out.
Back at Juha’s farm, Marja enters alone in rags, only to be abused again by her mother-in-law. Juha welcomes his wife back, warmly, believing she was taken by force. She tells him of Shemeikka’s new son, and Juha insists they leave to collect the child. Marja berates herself for lying to the man who has forgiven her. A ten-minute orchestral interlude leads to the final scene back at Shemeikka’s fishing cabin. Juha and Marja find the merchant as he comes from the sauna, mocking Juha. Goaded by Shemeikka Juha attacks him, smashing his arm and leg before Anja shouts out what everyone apart from Juha has known: Marja was not abducted by Shemeikka but followed him willingly. In horror, Juha runs out and throws himself in the nearby rapids.

In a letter accompanying his newly printed play (23 July 1776, aged 24) that he sent to his best friend, the German philosopher , Lenz described himself as ""an enigma to even his most precious friends"", while saying of the play, ""Here, into your holy hands, the piece which carries half of my existence.  [The ideas it contains are] true and will remain so, even if centuries may walk contemptuously across my skull"".
Zimmermann wrote and revised his opera in phases between 1957 and 1964; it was premiered in 1965 and dedicated to . Zimmermann himself faithfully adapted the play into the , the only changes to the text being repeats and small cuts. It is the composer's only completed opera and is considered an important work of the second half of the 20th century.

His original idea was to present the opera on twelve stages surrounding the audience, who would be seated on swiveling chairs. Upon reviewing an early scored version of this idea, however, the Cologne officials, including , advised Zimmermann that it would be impossible to realize .
In 1963 Zimmermann completed a  using music for the opera consistent with the original idea, to demonstrate in concert that the music could in fact be played. He did not, however, go on to complete a version of the  consistent with the original idea, as presented in draft form to Sawallisch and the other officials, according to his widow. Instead, from 1963 to 1964, during a study visit to the  in Rome, Zimmermann revised his composition into the version we know today in order to get it performed. The premiere followed the next year.
WDR () broadcast scenes from  in 1963, but the first staged performance, with Cologne Opera forces conducted by , did not take place until 15 February 1965, after Zimmermann completed revisions to the score in 1964. WDR documented this with a recording, made in sessions on 21 and 22 February and 2 and 3 March in its main studio. In 1969 Gielen also conducted the successful and widely reviewed  premiere run in Munich.
The first British performance came during the 1972 , when the  company took a 1971 Düsseldorf production to the King's Theatre.

Place:  and nearby  in . Time: (Zimmermann) ""Yesterday, today, and tomorrow.""

 : Marie has moved from Armentières to Lille with her father Wesener, a fancy goods merchant. She writes a letter to the mother of her fiancé, Stolzius, a young draper in Armentières, while her sister Charlotte does needlework. Charlotte's aria: . An argument breaks out between the sisters, Charlotte being scornful of Marie's love for Stolzius.
 : Stolzius has been lovesick since Marie's departure for Lille, but he is encouraged when his mother brings him a letter.
 : Desportes is a French-serving nobleman from , and one of Wesener's customers. He courts the commoner Marie and wins her affection. Her father, however, forbids her to go with him to the theatre: for a commoner to accompany an officer in public would damage the family name.
 : At the trenches in Armentières, officers discuss with Padre Eisenhardt the relative merits of comedy. Captain Haudy, one of the officers, holds the view that it has more value than a sermon. Eisenhardt maintains that comedy undermines the soldiers' sense of what is right – their loose morals have already brought misery to countless young women. Haudy counters with the argument, ""once a whore, always a whore"". No, replies Eisenhardt, a whore would never be a whore if she were not forced to become one.
 : Wesener advises his daughter to be cautious in her dealings with Desportes, although he secretly harbours the hope that she may marry the young aristocrat. In the meantime, he says, it would not be wise to give up Stolzius altogether. As stormclouds gather, Marie grows anxious at what lies ahead and the dilemma builds in her heart.
 : The officers discuss politics and Stolzius, and philosophize, at the Armentières café, owned by Madame Roux. When the Colonel and Eisenhardt leave, a jazzy dance begins (Rondeau à la marche), led by the Andalusian waitress:  After five couplets, this screeches to a halt upon the return of the Colonel and Eisenhardt with Haudy. Stolzius arrives, and the officers make insinuating remarks about Marie's relationship with Desportes. Tumult.

 : Marie has received a reproachful letter from Stolzius. She is reading it in tears when Desportes enters. He scornfully dictates to her a brusque reply. His flattery finally has the desired effect: his spot with Marie is won. In the room next door, Wesener's aged mother sings the folk song  with its prophetic line, . On a partitioned stage appear, on one side, Marie and Desportes as a couple engrossed in love play, and on the other, Stolzius and his mother, who is trying to convince her son that having broken off his engagement, the ""soldier's whore"" Marie was not worthy of him. But Stolzius defends her and swears revenge on Desportes.
 : A conversation between Eisenhardt and Captain Pirzel, whose odd behaviour is portrayed as the result of the monotony of military service, reveals that Captain Mary, a friend of Desportes, is to be transferred from Armentières to Lille.
 : In order to move closer to Marie, Stolzius offers Captain Mary his services as a batman.
 : Desportes has left Marie. When she starts accepting gifts from Captain Mary, her sister Charlotte labels her a ""soldier's girl"". Marie claims she only behaved in this way in order to get news of Desportes. Captain Mary invites Marie and Charlotte for a drive; neither of them recognizes the identity of his batman Stolzius.
 (Act 3 Zwischenspiel)
 : Gräfin de la Roche reproaches her son, the Young Count, for his behaviour toward Marie. She advises him to leave town and, in order to protect Marie from the advances of other officers, she declares herself willing to take the girl into her own house as a companion.
 : The Gräfin goes to find Marie at Wesener's house. In Charlotte's presence, she makes her offer, persuading Marie it is the only way she can now save her honour. Trio: .
 : What the future holds in store for Marie is a living nightmare. Films I, II and III. Having turned down the Gräfin's offer in order to try to renew her contact with Desportes, she is now subjected by Desportes to the attentions of his young gamekeeper, who makes a brutal sexual assault. Dishonored and discredited, Marie wanders aimlessly while the Gräfin, the Young Count, Wesener, Charlotte, Pirzel, and Eisenhardt all search for her.
 : Captain Mary and Desportes are eating their evening meal. Stolzius, who is serving them, overhears their conversation and learns of Marie's fate. He hands Desportes a bowl of poisoned soup and, before drinking some of the soup himself, triumphantly reveals his identity to the dying Desportes. Stolzius dies.
 : As Eisenhardt sings the , Marie, now sunk to the level of a street beggar, encounters her father and asks him for alms. Wesener does not recognize her, but, out of concern for his daughter, gives her money. He then joins an endless procession of enslaved and fallen soldiers, in which the drunken officers also take part. The procession builds to a vision of Hell: one human is raped by another, the individual by the collective conscience and, in this instance, by the power of the army.
Even today a stage performance of  places very great demands on any opera company. In addition to the sixteen singing and ten speaking roles, it requires a one hundred-piece orchestra involving many unusual instruments and pieces of percussion. With its open action, a large number of scenes which at times overlap one another or run simultaneously (the second scene of act 2, for example, or all of act 4), its multimedia structure incorporating film screens, projectors, tape recordings and loudspeakers, in addition to the sound effects of marching, engines and screams,  –an opera composed using the strict rules of twelve-tone music and presenting a high degree of complexity despite its careful design for the stage– is a uniquely complicated opera, both to stage and to watch.
There are numerous unorthodox roles in this opera, but the most noticeable is the mass usage of banging chairs and tables on the stage floor as percussion instruments. This is carried out by many of the actors with non-singing roles. The composer also calls for 3 cinema screens, 3 film projectors and groups of loudspeakers on the stage and in the auditorium.
The orchestra is composed of:

The stage players consist of 3 percussionists and a 3-player jazz-band.
Jazz band:
The prelude is written to sound as mechanical as possible, with dissonant combinations of instruments colliding against each other rhythmically to portray the mechanised movements of the soldiers on stage. As with 's operas  and , the individual scenes are built on strict musical forms; strophes, chaconnes, ricercare, toccatas, etc. Musically, the work makes extensive use of , and expresses debts to Berg's , such as in the shared name of the principal female role (Marie) and in the number of scenes (15).
Just as Zimmermann allows temporal levels to flow into one another, he also makes use of musical styles from several periods. Jazz rhythms (as in the coffee house scene),  chorales (from the ), a folksong and the  plainchant sequence are juxtaposed and assembled in a way which creates a score which seethes with tension.

The opera is in two acts of three scenes each, linked by interludes.
Sir Edgar, an English gentleman and scientist, visits a small German town with a vast entourage, including black slaves and a large collection of animals. The townspeople are curious about the new personage in their town, but Sir Edgar is initially aloof to the townsfolk. Through his secretary, Sir Edgar declines all invitations to social events, and the townspeople become angry at this attitude. In scene 2 of act 1, the Baroness Grünwiesel hosts a tea and expects Sir Edgar to attend, but he does not, via a note from his Moor servant. The Baroness promises revenge on Sir Edgar for this slight. In scene 3, a traveling circus sets up their show in front of Sir Edgar's residence. Sir Edgar leaves his house for the first time since his arrival, and enjoys the circus performance. However, when city officials try to talk with Sir Edgar, he again refuses. The city officials then shut the circus down, but Sir Edgar invites the circus troupe into his mansion.
At the start of act 2, several months have elapsed. A lamplighter hears screams and groans from Sir Edgar's mansion. He reports this to the town mayor, who demands an explanation from Sir Edgar. Sir Edgar's secretary explains that the noises are from Lord Barrat, Sir Edgar's nephew (the 'young lord' of the title), who has arrived recently in Germany and is learning German, but is making mistakes and is punished with lashings. However, the prospect of a pending social event at Sir Edgar's mansion becomes evident. This is fulfilled in scene 2 of act 2, where Lord Barrat is presented to the townspeople at a social event at Sir Edgar's mansion. Lord Barrat behaves eccentrically, but the townsfolk are charmed and begin to imitate his actions. Luise, the ward of the local baroness, had previously been in love with Wilhelm, a student, but now has become enamoured of the 'young lord'. Finally, in the climactic dance, Lord Barrat's attire falls from him, and he is revealed as a trained ape.

The setting is ancient Thebes. Prior to the opera, Dionysus has stated that he intends to revenge himself upon Agave and the women of Thebes because they have denied his divinity.
At the start of the opera, Cadmus, King of Thebes, has abdicated his throne in favour of his grandson Pentheus. Pentheus has learned of the cult of Dionysus, which involves wild and irrational revelry. Pentheus plans to ban the cult from his city. A stranger arrives in town and seduces the citizens into increasingly frenetic celebration of the god Dionysus. Because Pentheus is unaware of his own irrational, ""Dionysiac"" impulses, or tries to suppress them, Dionysus can entrance Pentheus and intrude upon his nature to the point that Pentheus disguises himself as a woman, and goes to Mount Cytheron, where the revelry is occurring. In the course of events, the spell over the citizens extends to Agave, Pentheus' mother, and Autonoe, Pentheus' sister. Pentheus is killed and torn to pieces, and his city brought to ruin. Without realising it, Agave cradles the severed head of her son in her arms. The Stranger is revealed to be Dionysus himself.

Antony and Cleopatra,Samuel Barber,"September 16, 1966","Metropolitan Opera, New York City",,1966,Franco Zeffirelli,", Op. 40, is an  in three acts by American composer . The  was prepared by . It was based on the play  by  and made use of Shakespeare's language exclusively.
The opera was first performed on September 16, 1966, commissioned for the opening of the new  in  in . After an unsuccessful premiere, the opera was extensively revised by Barber and  into an edition first performed in 1975.
For the world premiere—also the opening of the new —no expense was spared, with the creative team including Zeffirelli himself directing and designing the production. The team included revolutionary choreographer , conductor , and a top rate cast headed by  as Cleopatra.
Condensing Shakespeare's text from five acts in over forty scenes to three acts over three hours, Zeffirelli preserved much of the speaking style of the original tragedy. The stage design and costumes were elaborate; the cast was enormous including 22 principal singers, a full chorus, dozens of extras and a troupe of ballet dancers—a company of 400 performers on stage. Quickly utilizing the limits of the cutting-edge technology of the new opera house, the mammoth production was not without problems. A technical error during early rehearsals broke the house's new , causing the entire production to be restaged with movable scenery units. A large hydraulic pyramid of steel, brass, and aluminium dominated the stage with fold up sides that famously trapped Price during the dress rehearsal.
The opera was poorly received by the press, and not enthusiastically received by the public. Among the reasons cited for the opera's lack of success were an ""inflated production with problematic technical apparatus, gaudy costumes, overcrowded stage forces, and a press overly attentive to the social glitter of the occasion"". Less kindly, the 1966 premiere was retrospectively described as ""a hair-curlingly awful production. … The night has gone down in the annals of opera as a landmark of vulgarity and staging excess. Mr. Barber’s score, as we discovered from subsequent exposure to revised excerpts in concert and on records, was to a great extent an innocent victim of the over-all fiasco"". The opera was dropped from the Met's repertory after the initial eight performances of the production. The radio broadcast of the premiere, rarely heard after the initial broadcast, was released in 2016, upon the 50th anniversary of the premiere.
Barber later revised the opera, with text revisions by Gian-Carlo Menotti, Barber's partner and the librettist of his first opera, . This version was premiered under Menotti's direction at the  on February 6, 1975.

The opera is regarded as having ""enjoyed more success and popularity than its larger-scale predecessor,  [......] because its witty parodies are in the manner of [Walton's 1922] "" and the librettists' ability ""to emulate Chekhov's caricatures of the three main characters"" are also successful.
Popova is a widow, remaining faithful to the memory of her late husband, Popov.  Her servant, Luka, remarks upon her affected sorrow.  Smirnov, one of Popov's creditors, appears.  During the course of the story, it becomes clear that Popov was promiscuous and unfaithful to his wife.  Smirnov and Popova begin to quarrel, to the point where both aim loaded pistols at each other.  However, neither can fire, as they have fallen in love.  As the opera ends, Luka looks on in disbelief at the new lovers.
In contrast with Walton's previous opera , which used a large cast, full orchestra and chorus,  is deliberately minimal in its vocal and instrumental forces. The opera uses 3 singers and a chamber orchestra.

The Devils of Loudun,Krzysztof Penderecki,20 June 1969,Hamburg State Opera,German,1969,Penderecki," () is an  in three acts written in 1968 and 1969 by Polish composer , and then revised in 1972 and 1975. It has a German  by the composer, based on 's dramatization of 's .
The work was commissioned by the , which consequently gave the premiere on 20 June 1969. Only 48 hours afterwards, the opera received its second performance in , followed two months later by its American debut mounted by the . The work was revised in 1972 following suggestions by Polish theatre director . This added two new scenes, excluded a scene from the opera's first act, regrouped other scenes, and modified the first act's instrumentation. In 1975, Penderecki added two more scenes in the second act. He revised the entire score again in 2012.
, the first and most popular of Penderecki's operas, is emblematic of the composer's interest in historical events of traumatic nature. As suggested by its title, the opera draws its story line from the  in the town of , France. However, rather than a narrative of these historical events, the opera underscores a more general  between central and local power, and thus provides a political commentary, denouncing the iniquities committed by the  states of the mid-20th century.  Accordingly, the opera's thematic construction should be regarded as  rather than merely historical.
Based on the reviews listed in Cindy Bylander's  the reception of  varied. The opera received mixed reviews (mostly written around the same time and within a decade of the work's completion) in European countries and the US. Even in the same city, there were different reactions to the work.
The world premiere, which was given at the  on 20 June 1969, received mixed reviews. However, the general consensus among critics was that the work was not a huge success. A critic, who saw the world premiere performance of the work in Hamburg, wrote that the various sounds effects (i.e. cries, laughter, roars, etc.), large glissandi in orchestra, tone clusters, and pitches at extreme ends of instruments' ranges were used merely to produce atmosphere instead of creating a dramatic effect. After seeing a Hamburg production of the opera, another critic even questioned whether Penderecki was truly interested in the piece. , who created the role of Jeanne, later criticized the vocal writing, saying that Penderecki did not really understand how to properly compose for the voice. Positive reviews of the production were mostly on the libretto's intriguing nature.
The next performance, which was given only two days after its Hamburg world premiere, was held in . Critics agreed almost unanimously that the Stuttgart production of the opera was far superior to the Hamburg production. The Stuttgart audience was pleased by the daring staging and thought it was a thrilling piece of contemporary music. The Stuttgart production of the opera, however, received some negative reviews as well. A critic, who said the presentation was marked by sensation and grandiosity, commented that the music was indescribably boring.
Outside of Hamburg and Stuttgart, the opera received positive reviews in other German cities like Berlin, , , and . For example, a slightly revised version of  was performed in  in 1970. A critic, who saw the performance, wrote that the presentation was ""an electrifying unforgettable experience."" In 1980, a little more than ten years after the world premiere,  received generally cruel reviews in Cologne. A critic admits that the work was convincingly performed but thought the compositional originality was completely lacking. Another critic, after seeing the Cologne production, even wondered if the opera really deserved to remain in the repertoire.
In , critics and audience reacted lukewarmly to the premiere of the work in 1971. Some thought the music was tedious and lacked the good measure of the sensational, on which the success of Penderecki's opera depends. The second performance of the opera in  was greeted by a half-empty hall of audience. Another critic in Graz said that the opera only conveys the story line and does not create much dramatic impact until it becomes musically more interesting in the final act.
In Penderecki's native country , the first performance, which was held in  six years after its world premiere in 1969 and considerably less risqué, received generally very negative reviews. Even the composer himself did not think the work was performed successfully. In May 1998, almost thirty years after the world premiere of the opera, a critic commented that the work was artistically successful, but musically was less successful. The same critic, after seeing a performance of the opera in , also suggested that the work could even be called ""anti-opera.""
The French premiere of the opera in 1972 was rather disastrous; the performance was greeted with orange peels, turnips, leeks, cat-calls, and foot-stamping.  production of the opera, however, was praised for its set design and performers.
The British premiere in 1973, given by the Sadler's Wells Company, was not a great success either; the British critics were mostly unimpressed with the performance. The staging (by ) and the performers were praised, but the music was criticized for lack of drama and the libretto for its failure to arouse pity in the audience. One critic even cruelly wondered whether the Company's sparkling performance was worth the effort, given the poor quality of the music. However, a different critic thought the piece was a compelling form of musical theatre.
 was performed in other European countries, where the reviews were mixed again. The Italian premiere given in  in 1974 was praised. In , the performance was met with enthusiastic applause in 1976. In 1979, the Swiss premiere of the opera was given in  by the , and the overall impression of the performance was positive; even though a critic said that the libretto and the music failed to maintain the audience's interest, the high quality of staging and the performers made the presentation a positive experience.
The U.S. premiere of , which was given by  in 1969, received more negative reviews than positive ones. A critic, who attended the performance, praised its staging but thought its music failed to support the issues or events occurring on stage. Another critic wrote that the music did not have the ability to hold drama for a long period of time. A different critic even thought that the music was more appropriate for soundtrack than an opera. Even with these criticisms, the opera received better reviews in the U.S. than in . Especially, the staging in the U.S. praised over the staging in Europe.
The opera was recorded in 1969. The recording of  received mixed reviews as well. One critic wrote that ""the music is always striking, its style eclectic, and its images mesmerizing."" However, there were critics who disagreed by saying that the piece was made for an electronic medium rather than for an orchestra. The music was also accused of being harmonically static and lacking distinctive melodies.
The revised edition of 2012 premiered in 2013 at Det Kongelige Teater, Copenhagen.

Sister Jeanne, the abbess of the  convent in Loudun, is having night visions in which Father Grandier, the Vicar of St. Peter's Church, appears wearing a heretic shirt with a rope around his neck as he is escorted by two guards. This dreadful image of the parish priest is followed by another one; in this instance, however, Grandier rests in the arms of a woman. These macabre visions let Sister Jeanne, among other convent nuns, to the belief that they had been possessed by the devil, and thus to eventually confesses her visions to Father Mignon. In the meantime, Father Grandier's unchaste life is disclosed through his relationships with Ninon (a widow), and Philippe (a young woman). Furthermore, Grandier assures his fatal destiny by opposing the decree to demolish the city's fortifications put forth by the King and the powerful Cardinal Richelieu. The act comes to a close with the exorcism of Sister Jeanne performed by Barré, the Vicar of Chinon. Barré attempts to ask her ""possessor,"" who Jeanne calls : ""how did you gain entry to the body of this nun?"" Jeanne responds, in a man's voice: ""through the offices of a friend."" Jeanne states that the friend is Grandier.

Jeanne's exorcism continues. This time, however, Barré is assisted by Father Mignon and Father Rangier; yet, the attempts to expel the devil are unsuccessful. Following, Grandier denies ever seeing Jeanne, and implores God to help her. Nonetheless, his words prove feeble as Jeanne claims that he had forced the Ursuline nuns to practice black magic.  The situation becomes even more convoluted when Philippe informs Grandier that she is bearing his child. Meanwhile, the exorcisms continue now in public at St. Peter's Church, where Grandier is arrested as he enters.

Grandier is held responsible for the demonical possessions of the Ursuline nuns, accused of conspiracy with the devil, and indicted for blasphemy and unchastity. He is, consequently, sentenced to public torture and death at stake. Grandier's death thus becomes a realization of Jeanne's visions. Finally, Jeanne comes to realize that her unanswered love for Grandier was the cause of her possession.
Andrzej Tuchowski states in  that the most interesting aspect of the opera is Penderecki's sensitivity toward what goes on invisibly in the minds of almost all the characters in the opera: the  state of a socially  individual, that of the society, that of the struggle between them, etc. This multi-layering of the psychological states corresponds to the general tendencies in the 20th-century music theatre, such as valuing the conflicts that occur in the inner world of the characters. Another tendency in the music of the time, according to Tuchowski, was a departure from the past; music started to sound less and less familiar to the ears of the audience.  In order to sustain the interest of the listeners in the new foreign-sounding music, it became essential for composers to find a way to connect with the audience.
For his first and experimental opera, Penderecki chose a story about a sensational scandal that happened in France long before his time. Surely, the story was stimulating enough to catch the attention of the audience. Moreover, it has a stronger connection with the audience below the surface; in a deeper level, the psychological aspects of the story make allusions to various historical events and tendencies in the society and its people of the time. In , the social outsider, Grandier, struggles alone against intolerance, , and organized violence of the society. Tuchowski shows various ways that the psychological subtleties of the relationships between value systems (i.e. religious or political organizations, etc.) and an outsider in this work could be analyzed. 
First of all, there is the conflict between a  and the unforgiving society. The opera ends with Grandiers's death, which was facilitated by the society's intolerance for an outsider. In the midst of the nuns proclaiming to have been  in order to make excuses for their misbehavior, Grandier, who claims to be innocent, stands out as a non-conforming social outcast. He has many qualities that distinguish him from others: his outstanding intelligence and good looks that incur the hatred and jealousy of some local notables; his sexual attractiveness that results in Jeanne's obsessions and accusations; his disobedience to the political powers that proves fatal in the process of his destruction. Most of the time, a non-conforming social outsider must face an atmosphere of intolerance, fanaticism or at least indifference in the society. This common phenomenon of ostracizing the non-conforming member of the society works similarly in ; in the end, Grandier's virtues and weaknesses alike, which make him unique, turn finally against him and bring him death.
Grandier's death, however, was not a result easily granted. In value systems, anything unjustifiable or unofficial is usually considered void. As afore mentioned, the atmosphere of intolerance provides suitable conditions to eliminate an unwelcome individual. This atmosphere alone, however, is not enough to give permission to eliminate the individual; the most important ingredient needed for the removal of the unwanted is the official prosecution. In the process of bringing out this official , the many unclean deeds by the authorities such as usurpation and manipulation of power come to light. For example, the  and death of Grandier reveals the ethical weakness of any absolute or .
In the eyes of the  in the opera, the attractive and politically opposing Grandier could be seen as a threat to their power. The fact that Grandier is an outsider was a perfect reason for the authorities to eliminate him from the society. The society, however, could not murder this unwelcome figure simply out of hatred, because that would be illegal and would have no proper justification. In order to officially persecute Grandier, the society as a collectivity condemned him “evil,” which must be rid of. This form of injustice happened frequently in the 20th century. Perhaps the most notable example among many others is the  of  by the . Penderecki is telling his audience that the official persecution of Grandier in the opera is the same injustice brought by the totalitarian states in the 20th century, only in a much smaller scale.
The composer then tries to explain the source of this injustice in the opera by demonstrating that the incompatibility between Christian ethic and  violence could become a basis of power. Based on his betrayal of faith among other misdeeds, it is difficult to label Grandier as a true . Moreover, the church authorities played the most important role in leading Grandier to his death. Grandier, however, is the most moral person that deserves to be called Christian in the world that the opera presents: a sickeningly corrupt and grotesque one. Tuchowski claims that Grandier's moral victory is emphasized by clear references to 's .
The final scenes of the opera are obviously a reference to Christ's . Making this reference even stronger is the last scene of execution, with Father Barre's -like kiss of betrayal and Grandier's last words: Forgive them, forgive my enemies. Throughout the events of false accusations, Grandier does not fight against his enemies, who believe that violence committed in the name of  is justifiable. Moreover, Grandier does not hate his persecutors; he forgives them and accepts approaching death with dignity. Grandier's and martyrdom and death show that in the imperfect world like ours, where violence exists in abundance, the inevitable conflict between  (Grandier's non-violence and sacrifice, etc.) and the organized violence (execution of the innocent, etc.) of the political authorities could be used to bring out results of injustice; in the case of Grandier, an undeserved death.
Presented in the midst of all the events are the various states of  in different . Grandier represents a psychologically complicated individual, full of internal contradictions. He is able to make judgments (although not always right) and stand for himself. The human psyche in a larger group setting, however, is dissimilar from its state in  and works differently. For example, the townsmen of Loudun, who are presumably all goodhearted as individuals, view the destruction of Grandier as a good show; and the nuns undergo a  as they start believing their own made-up stories. In order to musically portray the variable human psyche, Penderecki made the voice parts sing in different styles in different social settings; For example, Sister Jeanne sings differently when she is singing to herself than when she is singing to other people. Penderecki portrays these various ways that human psyche works with the intention of alluding to the 20th-century totalitarian systems' manipulation of the human mind. Because the manipulation is what they have experienced, Penderecki's audience of the time must have found themselves engaged and connected to the work written in a novel language of sound.
The , written by the composer, is based on 's German translation of 's dramatization of 's essay . The employment of existing literature as the basis for the librettos was not exclusive to ; instead, it became the invariant among Penderecki's four operas; namely , , and .  The libretto is written in German (although both Polish and English adaptations exist) and it is fashioned into a series of thirty two scenes, which proceed, from one to another, quasi cinematically.
The libretto to  refers to the mid-17th-century events in Loudun, France, concerning the demoniacal possession of the Ursuline nuns and their abbess, Mother Jeanne. A parish priest, , was accused of the alleged possessions and indicted for conspiracy with Satan.  Consequently, in August 1634, Father Grandier was sentenced to burn at the stake. Nevertheless, it is claimed that the underlying cause of Grandier's fall was a political one, for the priest had secret alliances against the powerful , who planned to deprive Loudun of independence.  The possessions continued for a number of years, yet Penderecki's libretto comes to a closure with Grandier's death for an obvious reason — Grandier is the main character of the opera, so with his death the opera ends.
The Loudun episode attracted the attention of composers, writers, historians, psychologists and the sort. The capacity of the events for generating a multiplicity of interpretations and intertwining religious elements with political ones granted the possibility of new plots, new compositions, and new answers. In addition to Penderecki, the theme of  appealed to other Polish artists, including , , and Romuald Twardowski.
Even though the libretto for  is based on Whiting's play , the two stories are fundamentally different. The libretto shortens, omits, and reorders some of the scenes of Whiting's play.  Most significant is the emotional and ideological dissimilarities of Penderecki's and Whiting's protagonist Grandier. Indeed, the Whiting's Grandier and Penderecki's Grandier are two different characters.
Whiting portrays Grandier as an existentialist, striving for self-destruction. His enemies and the political circumstances surrounding him are just tools helping him achieve his goal. Thus, the tragic fate of Whiting's Grandier is not the doing of the society, but the result of his own actions. Furthermore, Edward Boniecki remarks that “Whiting's protagonist is a living-dead.”
Penderecki's libretto transforms Whiting's existentialist Grandier into a hero and symbol of struggle against obscurantism. It does so by placing the priest's actions into a different context, enabling a different interpretation of the events. From this perspective, Grandier's obsession for self-destruction is reinterpreted as a desire for a martyr death. In fact, it is argued that Grandier represents a Christ-like figure, for both were unjustly accused, accepted their death, and forgave their torturers.  Similarly, the fate of Penderecki's Grandier is seen to be dominated by the context rather than by the individual. Penderecki's Grandier is, in this sense, a victim of political conspiracy and of religious-political fanatics.
 is an   written in an  style, conveying feelings of insanity and portraying the characters in psychotic states. In fact, it may be compared to 's monumental  opera, : ""Penderecki's flexible style, like Berg's, is ideally suited to capture the essence of emotional states,"" and thus develop several planes of expressive characterization.
 is written in Penderecki's trademark textural style, which utilizes a number of textural and sonoric techniques, including wedges and group ,  clusters, a range of , instrumental , and percussive effects. However, in , Penderecki's  is brought to new heights, serving now a crucial dramatic purpose. In effect, it is possible to conceive the opera's drama as the sole opposition between Penderecki's  and  styles.
 dramatic style is also influenced by genres outside of opera. While the use of , soloist, and  fragments all adhere to the operatic tradition, the influence of theatrical genres is evident on the operas' extensive use of speech. To this effect, the libretto, divided into 32 scenes, may also be regarded as a byproduct of a theatrical influence. In addition, it is possible to perceive some elements of  in the male-voice quartet at the end of the second act; while the reference to the  is obvious on the martyrdom figure of Grandier.
 is scored for enormous musical forces, including nineteen soloists, five choruses (nuns, soldiers, guards, children, and monks), orchestra, and tape. The orchestra itself is of a great size too, making use of a very particular blending of instruments. The orchestra is composed of the following instrumentation.
Nonetheless, this extraordinarily large ensemble is used with great moderation by the composer. In particular, Penderecki exploits the use of chamber ensembles coupled by their correspondence of timbre quality and specific coloristic effect.  With the resulting palette of orchestral colors at his command, Penderecki is able to provide a musical commentary and thus determine the expressive quality of a given scene.  While the smaller ensembles predominate through the work, Penderecki resources to the full ensemble resonance for dramatic effect, emphasizing this way the most emotionally charged scenes, such as the exorcisms of the Ursuline nuns and the death of Grandier.
The orchestration is written in  format, that is with very little metrical guidelines, very few rests, and includes some  effects of notes and tone-clouds in approximate pitches. Penderecki's work-method at the time was to develop his musical ideas in various colored pencils and inks, although the final score does not use color-coding.
 calls for the use of a number of extended techniques on its instrumental writing. The use of such techniques is also for coloristic purposes. These extended techniques are evidently associated with specific notational symbols. Some of these techniques are: bowing in-between the bridge and the , bowing the right marrow side of the bridge, and bowing the string holder.
 makes use of a set of music-action relationships that help reinforce and propel the drama. Yet, not all of these music-action associations are of the same nature, some serve a more illustrative purpose, while others provide a musical characterization of specific situations and actions.
The illustrative music-action relationships are most evident in Penderecki's use of performing forces. The comic and grotesque scenes are usually set in chamber music, characterized by pointillistic textures and discontinuous motifs. Furthermore, the chamber ensembles portrayed in these comic scenes often feature rather disjointed timber combinations, thus resulting in an overall comical effect. In the contrast, the music depicting the dramatic scenes is scored for larger forces, featuring thicker textures and darker tone colors. To achieve these dramatic massive textures, Penderecki relies on the use of stationary tones, glissandos, and various sound clusters. The chaotic sonorities, resulting from Penderecki's sound-mass techniques, are used in particular to convey the demonical possession of Sister Jeanne.
While the composer depends on his instrumental writing for providing an expressive context to the actions, it is his use of many different vocal styles that enables a musical characterization of Father Grandier and Sister Jeanne. It is thus through these vocal lines that the characters' moral, mental, and emotional states are judged. The correct literary style of Grandier is emphasized in the opera by the fluency of the recitative, its coherence with speech intonations and subdued expression. In addition, Grandier's use of speech in the second act may be interpreted as representative of the protagonist's sobriety. In contrast, Jeanne's vocal style is very pointillist. The frequent leaps, changes of character, drastic dynamic changes, and glissando, characteristic of Jeanne's vocal part, are emblematic of her hysteria and falseness. Furthermore, Jeanne's demonical possession is underscored by the use of laughter, groans, and electronic distortion of her voice.

Lasting half an hour, it is scored for a  with an extraordinary command of  covering more than five , and six players ( + percussion):
Extended techniques are also required by the instrumentalists: for example there is frequent use of  and  for the wind instruments and the pianist is required to play inside the piano with a . In the third song all the instrumentalists except the flautist play bird-calls and mechanical bird noises. Although most of the techniques are notated quite specifically, there are passages of guided improvisation, most obviously in the wind instruments at the end of the 5th song, when they are instructed to ""use given pitches as centres around which groups — small, slow phrases, are built.""
Like its predecessor, , different movements make use of different combinations from the ensemble. The full ensemble is used in the first, third, fifth, and seventh songs as well as the first transition. The second song omits the wind instruments; the fourth song omits the wind instruments, violin, and piano; the sixth song omits the flute (with the exception of the first, very short, chord); the second transition omits the baritone; the eighth song omits the violinist (as the instrument has been smashed by this point).
The piece moves through a variety of different rhythmic characters. Some passages, such as the second transition, are strictly pulsed with a relatively clear  (although extensive use of ), others use overlapping tempi (e.g. in the first and fifth songs), and there is also extensive use of recitative, most obviously in the cello-baritone duet of the fourth song.
The piece is generally written in a modernist idiom, although it makes frequent use of pastiche, allusion, and direct quotation. The songs derive from tunes played by an extant  owned by George III, tunes that he attempted to train  to sing:

The opera was not seen during Berwald’s lifetime, and first staged at the  in Stockholm on 3 April 1968.

The story concerns the widowed Queen of Golconda, Aline, who as a girl in Provence had loved Saint Phar. However, she was abducted as a child and sold as a slave to the old King of Golconda who then married her. Saint Phar has recently appeared at court as the new French ambassador. The veiled Aline is not recognised by Saint Phar who delivers to her a friendship treaty with France. At a later meeting in the French gardens where Aline comes in Provençal attire, it emerges that he is still in love with her. Aline and her court are held prisoner during a revolution led by Sadomar, but she is rescued by Saint Phar, to whom she finally reveals her face.

 starts with three fairies chanting about the grim future of the Basque Country (the invasion of the Normans and the betrayal of Zunbeltz). However, these fairies also announce a plentiful era which will arrive with Sancho Garcés, destined to be the first , guide of the Basques.
Zunbeltz defies God and vows to claim the crown. His first action is an unsuccessful attempt on the life of the infant Sancho Garcés; he kills the wrong baby. When Garces becomes a man, Zunbeltz accuses him of double treason: patriotic treason (for dealings with the Normans who are destroying the Basque coasts) and treason of love (a romance with Sorgin, the daughter of a Norman who lives in the Basque lands).
San León assures the captured Basques that God will break their chains, allowing them to defeat the enemy, as anything that disrupts or circumvents the divine balance will be punished. This is where the title , punishment, comes from.
At the end of the opera, the punishment begins: the Normans who try to gain power in Navarre lands are punished with defeat. The evil Zunbeltz is punished both psychologically (remorse, hallucinations, murder of a child) and physically, when he accidentally wounds his daughter, Lore, fatally.

Punch and Judy,Harrison Birtwistle,8 June 1968,Aldeburgh Festival,,1968,Stephen Pruslin," is a  with music by  and a  by , based on the puppet figures of the . Birtwistle wrote the score from 1966 to 1967. The opera was first performed at the , which had commissioned the work, on 8 June 1968, with  conducting the English Opera Group. The premiere cast included  as Mr Punch.
The work caused great controversy with members of the audience, because of the violence of the plot and the nature of the music.  was reported to have left the premiere at the interval. The first US performance was in Minneapolis, and the first New York performance took place in 1988. The first performance in Austria was in 1991, by Wien Modern, with Birtwistle supervising the production. Birtwistle directed a revival of the opera at Aldeburgh in June 1991.
With reference to the ballet of ,  has characterized Mr Punch as ""the exact contrary of : a human being behaving as a puppet"". David Wright has summarized how Birtwistle and Pruslin attempted to treat the characters and music in an archetypal manner to write what they have described as a ""source opera"".  Jonathan Cross has published a detailed analysis of the opera.
The orchestra consists of:
Punch is rocking his baby, then throws it into the fire. He stabs Judy to death when she finds the charred baby. Punch is now free to seek Pretty Polly, and he leaves on his horse. He finds her and offers her a flower, which she refuses, saying it was tarnished by his murder of his baby.
The Doctor and Lawyer revive Punch, but they too are murdered (with a gigantic hypodermic needle and quill, respectively), and join Judy at the chorus gibbet. Punch again woos Pretty Polly, giving her a prism. Again she rejects him. Punch murders the Choregos, a narrator figure, by sawing him in half (within a bass viol case). This is a turning point in Punch's life, and the cyclical nature of the work changes.
Punch is haunted by nightmarish images of his cruelty and a satanic wedding with Judy. Punch goes to the gallows for his crimes, but cheats the hangman into hanging himself. Pretty Polly reappears and the two sing a love duet around the gallows, now transformed into a maypole.

Prometheus,Carl Orff,24 March 1968,Staatstheater Stuttgart,,1968,Aeschylus," is an  by . The opera's Greek text is based on the drama (:  –  –  by , the only surviving part of his  trilogy. Since Aeschylus’s text in Ancient Greek has been directly set to music without alterations or cuts, Orff’s score qualifies as one of the most typical examples for the operatic genre of . The  took place on March 24, 1968 at  under the direction of  in a production by  with sets and costumes by .
The titan , who has been placed in Scythian iron chains because of his alleged fire robbery, does not want to reveal to the Olympic ruler  a secret knowledge that he claims to possess.  asks Prometheus one last time to finally name the hetaerae who would cost Zeus and his followers their eternal rule. When Prometheus refuses, he is struck by lightning and thunder from an earthquake which throws him into the shadowy realm of the .
 (Greek: ""Power"") and  (Greek: ""Violence""), the servants of , drag Prometheus to the  mountains, where, at Zeus' command, the reluctant  chains Prometheus to a rock of the Caucasus. Hephaistos takes pity on Prometheus, but is also afraid of Zeus and his accomplices.
After Hephaistos, Kratos and Bia have left, the chorus of the daughters of  appears; they assures him of his friendship and inquire about the reason for this punishment. Prometheus tells about his fight against , helping Zeus to overthrow his father through cunning and cleverness. Zeus then passed the offices, but did not think of the humans, so that only Prometheus came to their support; he gave them the fire, hope and the art of prophecy. The chorus warns him of his audacity, whereupon Prometheus declares that despite his knowledge of his future punishment, he did it for the sake of people.
The chorus flies away, whereupon Okeanos rides on stage on his griffin. He describes himself as the greatest friend of Prometheus and claims that he hurried to his side as quickly as possible. But Prometheus asks him if he wants to indulge in his suffering and is outraged again about Zeus. Okeanos also warns him about the lack of submission to the new ruler. Prometheus should submit and ask for mercy so that he would be redeemed. But he reacts with irony to this advice from Okeanos, who had not supported the people with him. Okeanos offers to appeal to Zeus, but Prometheus advises him against it, referring to his brothers  and . Okeanos is persuaded and flies away.
The chorus returns and laments Prometheus's deplorable fate. Thereupon Prometheus tells what knowledge he brought to the human race, including medicine, seafaring, meteorology and divination. He also announces that Zeus will abdicate one day and Prometheus will be redeemed. The , though, should not tell Zeus about his future so that his prophecy will come true. The chorus laments the suffering of Prometheus and the lack of help from the human race which had enjoyed Prometheus's support.
The horned , daughter of Inachos, enters on stage. Prometheus announces the end of Zeus's reign to her by a son of . When Io learns that Prometheus has mastered the art of divination, she wants him to predict her own fate. Before that, however, she reports how she dreamed of Zeus's love. Therefore, Inachos, the father of Io, received the news from an  and decided to expel his daughter from the country. To cover up the love for Io, he turned her into a cow. But this was not hidden from Hera; she sent Argos as a guard and had the cow chased by a . Now Prometheus announces Io's future: She will cross the  (which will be named after her) and will eventually reach  following the Nile Delta to  to give birth to  there. A descendant of the Io's in the 13th generation, a ""hero of the bow"" (i.e. ) will one day save Prometheus. Since Io can no longer bear the stings of the gadfly, she escapes.
Prometheus reveals to the chorus of the Okeanids that Zeus' curse will come to an end. Hermes comes in and demands that Prometheus open up to Zeus who will overthrow him. He threatens with lightning and storm, which would hurt Prometheus badly; an eagle sent by Zeus would come to eat Prometheus's liver. Since Prometheus refuses to disclose this knowledge, he is punished by Zeus: the rock with the titan forged onto it sinks into Hades.
The score of Orff's  calls for an instrumentation that is unique in music history:
The large percussion section requires 15 to 18 players:
The chromatic tenor xylophones are instruments of the . Since they are not normally used in the percussion section of the symphony orchestra because of the  arrangement of their keys, in current performance practice marimbaphones are substituted. However, since chromatic glissandi can only be performed on chromatic tenor xylophones, these instruments from Orff's Schulwerk are included in limited numbers in order to allow for the performance of chromatic glissandi. The score of  therefore reflects the performance practice of all three of Orff's operas on subjects from Greek Antiquity.
While at the time of the premiere, the performance of the percussion section required considerable skills from the percussionists, thanks to the extraordinary development of the percussion technology in the past decades, Orff's score no longer offers insurmountable obstacles.
As Pietro Massa was able to show, an intensive exchange of ideas with the classical philologist , the musicologist  and with , the director who had originally been selected by the composer for the staging of the world premiere,  accompanied the genesis of Orff's operas on subjects from Greek Antiquity. Orff made the decision, revolutionary for the time when the work was created, to set the original Greek text after extensive consultation with Wolfgang Schadewaldt, who advised the composer on detailed questions of Greek metrics. Since the quantitative metrics of Ancient Greek poetry are incompatible with the accent metrics of modern European languages as well as with the metrical structure of European art music, the composer chose the solution not to let the text, which had to be declaimed rhythmically by the singer's speaking voice during long passages of the opera, be decanted in a rhythm that corresponded to the ancient Greek meter of the original, but to add to the syllable order of the ancient Greek text the second layer of an autonomous musical rhythm. Since vast parts of the score require a rhythmic declamation of the Greek text in the speaking voice of the soloists, which is only occasionally interrupted by strong accents of the gigantic percussion, the score of  also marked a new stage in Orff's departure from traditional pitch structures in comparison with his previous operas on Greek dramas.
Concentrating on an ensemble of percussion instruments with a specific and indefinite pitch, originally certainly born out of the fascination that the orchestra's only still evolving group exercised on 20th-century composers, appeared to be a veritable patent solution for a composer for whom the creation of purely diastematic organizations had never been a central concern. The idea of a differentiated cooperation based on the division of labor, which has distinguished the orchestra of Western art music that has grown organically over the centuries, in the orchestra of Orff's operas on Greek Antiquity appears transposed onto instrument constellations that were previously unknown to European art music. In the score of , the four pianos and the xylophones, which in the traditional orchestra were only given marginal tasks, take on the role that the string body had in the orchestration of Viennese classical music. On the other hand, the basic instruments of the traditional European symphony orchestra – such as flutes, oboes, trumpets and double basses – become entrusted in Orff's scores with functions that had been the realm of the rare percussion instruments in the 19th-century orchestra tradition. Their special timbres, which possess an  almost exotic sound appeal, are only used for special, dramaturgically motivated tasks.
The inclusion of numerous non-European percussion instruments that had not previously been used in the orchestra of European art music cannot be interpreted as musical , especially since the composer hardly uses the new timbres unmixed. Rather, the gathering of instruments from all parts of the world in the orchestra of Orff's last works for the stage serves to substantiate the claim that the setting of the ancient Greek myth should reveal the all-encompassing nature of the Greek myth which appeals to mankind in its entirety.
In the history of 20th-century music, Orff's operas on subjects from Greek Antiquity appear as an extraordinarily original development of musical dramaturgy after 1949. In recent decades, and especially after the year 2000, Orff's late style has attracted an increasing interest from opera houses and from musicological research alike, not least because of the obvious relationship between Orff's musical language and the tendencies of .
Only five months after the opera's world premiere, on 1 August 1968, Orff's  received a second, highly successful production at the  Munich, conducted by  and staged by  with the sets and costumes designed by ; this production has received the composer's special praise. After the great success of these initial performances, the enormous difficulties of the title role, the problem of assembling a large collection of exotic percussion instruments and the reluctance of smaller opera houses to stage a work written in Ancient Greek have hindered a broader diffusion of Orff's score, although some basic notions of Ancient Greek would have been present at least among some members of an educated opera audience in Western Germany. After the year 2000, a renewed interest in Carl Orff's late style has led to a rediscovery of his operas on subjects from Greek Antiquity; in the meantime, opera scores with a  in rare or non-Western languages had become increasingly common. Among the productions of the last decade, a production in the context of the festival  (Duisburg 2012), conducted by  and with the staging, sets and costumes by the Samoan director , has met with special success. Further performances in concert were presented in 2013 (Munich), in 2015 in the context of the Orff festival in Diessen/Ammersee, and again 2015 in Munich.

:
The opera is set on two levels: the upper level depicts the deck of an ocean liner after the Second World War where a German couple, Lisa and Walter (a West German diplomat on his way with his new wife to a new diplomatic posting), are sailing to Brazil. The wife, Lisa, thinks she recognises a Polish woman on board, Marta, as a former inmate of  where she, unknown to her husband, was a camp guard. The second lower level develops below the liner deck, depicting the concentration camp. The opera is an interplay between the two levels.
 : Walter and his wife Lisa are on their way to a new life in Brazil where Walter will take up a diplomatic post. During the journey, Lisa is struck by the appearance of a passenger she sees indistinctly. The passenger reminds her of an inmate in Auschwitz who was under her orders and who she knows for certain is dead. In shock, she reveals her hitherto undisclosed wartime past to her husband.
 : In the concentration camp, Lisa and her superior overseer discuss the need to manipulate prisoners and find one amongst each group who can be manipulated to lead the others easily. The male officers drink and sing about how there is nothing to do but how they are less likely to die than fighting on the front against the Russians.
 : The women of the camp are introduced and each tells of their background and origins. A Russian woman is brought in having been beaten and tortured and the  in charge discovers a note which may cost her her life. Marta is selected by Lisa to translate it, but deliberately makes it out to be a love letter from her partner Tadeusz, with whom she had been deported to the camp, but who she has not seen these past two years. Lisa believes the subterfuge. As the scene closes Lisa and Walter are seen on the boat in the present time trying to come to terms with Lisa's uncovered past.
 : Belongings of murdered prisoners are being sorted by the women when an officer arrives to demand a violin so that the Kommandant may have his favourite waltz rendered to him by a prisoner. The prisoner Tadeusz is sent to collect the violin and arrives to discover his fiancée Marta there. Their reunion is overseen by Lisa who decides to try and manipulate their relationship so that she may more easily control Marta for her own purposes so as to extend control over all the women prisoners.
: Tadeusz is in his prison workshop fashioning jewellery for the officers' private demands. In a pile of his sketches, Lisa recognises the face of Marta. Lisa tries to get Tadeusz to do her bidding also, but seeing that this would leave him indebted to Lisa, he declines, although this will now cost him his life.
 : It is Marta's birthday and she sings a lengthy aria to Death itself. Lisa tells Marta that Tadeusz refused her offer and that it will cost him dear, but Marta understands Tadeusz's stance. The women prisoners sing about what they will do when they return home after the war, although it is clear that this will not happen. There is a death-house selection, and the women are all led away as their numbers are called. Marta resignedly follows although she has not been selected for death. Lisa stops her from joining the others and taunts her that her time will come shortly so there is no need to hurry.Lisa's final taunt is that she will live to see Tadeusz's final concert before he is too sent to the death-house as a result of her report.
 : In the present time on the boat, Walter and Lisa are still unsure as to whether the mystery woman whose appearance has so upset Lisa is really Marta. The porter Lisa  bribed earlier to discover the woman's identity only revealed that she was British. He now returns to add that although she is travelling on a British passport, she is not English and is on deck reading a Polish book. Walter offers to confront the mystery woman to set Lisa's mind at rest before they both decide they are letting their minds run away with themselves. They both resolve to join the dancing in the salon. Lisa dances whilst her husband talks to another passenger. The mystery woman is seen passing a play-request to the band leader. The band then play the same tune that was once the camp Kommandant's favourite waltz. This musical coincidence and the still unknown identity of the passenger further convinces Lisa that Marta is somehow alive and on the boat. Lisa is reduced to terror and shrinks from sight of the mystery passenger retreating from her down the stairs of the liner into the horrors of Tadeusz's final moments.
 : Tadeusz is dragged before the Kommandant to provide him with his favourite waltz music. Instead he plays the Chaconne from Bach's , making a defiant purely musical protest. Thus he deprives Lisa of her plan to have him executed via her report and deprives the Kommandant of his illusion that he can force people to play him his favourite music under pain of death. Tadeusz seals his own fate and, his violin being smashed, he is dragged off to his death. All the while, Lisa observes the scene whilst still in her ballgown.
 : The stage becomes completely empty apart from Lisa still in her ballgown who slumps down sitting to the rear silently. Marta enters. She is observed to be wearing non-prisoncamp clothing and with her hair unshaven. She sings that the dead should never be forgotten and they can never forgive. Lisa can only observe, unable to have Marta change her attitude and provide her the closure she craves. The scene fades away musically as does the light and the opera ends very quietly in total darkness.
At no point in the opera is the mystery woman on the boat confirmed as Marta nor does Lisa or anyone ever interact with her on the boat.  Lisa's certainty that Marta died in the camp is never contradicted. The final scene, which is designed to be ambiguous, gives no indication as to whether or not  Marta survives.

María de Buenos Aires,Ástor Piazzolla,8 May 1968,"Sala Planeta, Buenos Aires",Spanish,1968,Horacio Ferrer," is a   () with music by  and  by  that premiered at the Sala Planeta in Buenos Aires on 8 May 1968.
The first part of the  plot centers on the experiences of a  in , ; the second part takes place after her death. The characters include María (and, after her death, the Shadow of María), a singer of ; various members of the Buenos Aires underworld; a  who functions as a poet and narrator; a goblin-like ; several  under the control of the duende; a circus of ; pasta makers; and construction workers. Many elements of the libretto suggest parallels between María and  (in , ) or  himself.
While certainly not in the narrow sense an , because the dance is tango rather than classical , it falls within the tradition of having set dance pieces integral to an operatic work.
The music draws on the  idiom for which Piazzolla is famous. The original idea for the story was conceived by Piazzolla's lover at the time of its composition, , who was married to Eduardo ""Lalo"" Palacios. The title role was originally conceived for Martin, but while Piazzolla was still composing the operita, he and Martin broke up after he asked her husband for her hand at Christmas in 1967.  According to Martin, Piazzolla said to Lalo, ""She is music, she can't belong to anybody, no she is music, she is music, and that's me.""  After their rift, a replacement was desperately needed, but Piazzolla soon met folksinger  at the Buenos Aires nightclub Nuestro Tiempo, formerly known as ""676"" and once Piazzolla's home base in Argentina.  Baltar's identification with the character María, paired with her beauty and captivating stage presence, made her ideal for the role.
The piece is written for at least three vocalists (one of whom, the narrator, mainly speaks rather than sings).  For the orchestration Piazzolla augmented his current working quintet: Piazzolla (),  (violin), Jamie ""El Russo"" Gosis (piano), Oscar Lopez Ruiz (guitar) and  (double bass); with viola, cello, flute, percussion, vibraphone and xylophone, and a second guitar.   has often been performed with dancers as well as musicians. There are several extant arrangements, including Piazzolla's own and one by .
For some years,  was seldom staged, though increasingly there have been modern productions, some in concert form and often incorporating dance. The opera had its United States premiere at  in 1991. The Pan American Symphony Orchestra, based in Washington, D.C. and led by Argentine conductor Sergio Buslje, premiered the work in Washington, D.C. in September 1996 and performed it again in March 2001. (Washington Post, September 19, 1996; Washington Post, March 19, 2001). The United Kingdom premiere took place on 2 June 2000 as part of the BOC Covent Garden Festival at the Peacock Theatre, London. A semi-staged performance at the Grand Thermae Villa in Rome in 2003 was recorded and has been released on DVD by Kultur Video.
In 2004, John Abulafia created a fully staged dance-theatre production of Maria de Buenos Aires, set close to the time it was composed - Argentina's 'Dirty War'. Maria, danced and sung by Julieta Anahi Frias, was one of the many who were 'disappeared' by the Military Junta. The production toured to UK's Bath Theatre Royal, Buxton Opera House and Norwich Theatre Royal.  in Minneapolis, Minnesota (2005), the Teatro Nacional de São João (Porto) and the Opera São Carlos (Lisbon) in Portugal (2006, 2007, toured Norway in 2007), the Gotham Chamber Opera at Skirball Center, in New York City (2008), Canberra, Australia (National Multicultural Festival, 2008) and the very successful Teatro di Capua production (2008) which has been produced in several theatres including the Hermitage Theatre in St Petersburg, Russia, Moscow (where it received two nominations in the Moscow Festival of the  in 2009), and the 2010 Edinburgh Festival.
A new fully staged production by Australian dance company Leigh Warren and Dancers and the State Opera of South Australia opened in Adelaide on 15 October 2010  and performed at the Brisbane Festival in September 2011. A reworked version of this production featured in the Victorian Opera 2013 season in Melbourne, as a collaboration between Leigh Warren and Dancers and the  performed at .

"Help, Help, the Globolinks!",Gian Carlo Menotti,21 December 1968,Hamburg State Opera,German,1968,"Menotti, translated by "," is an  in four scenes by  with an original English  by the . It was commissioned by the  and first performed as  in a German translation by  on December 21, 1968, in a double bill with Menotti's . The opera had its English language premiere on August 1, 1969, in the United States at the  in a double bill with 's . Both premiere productions were directed by the composer. Many of the cast members from the Santa Fe production reprised their roles for the work's New York debut at the  in December 1969.
The opening fugue is interrupted by a police bulletin telling us that dangerous creatures known only as Globolinks have landed on earth. A ballet follows accompanied by recorded electronic music, during which the Globolinks are shown invading our planet.

The Globolinks disable a school bus on a country road as it returns from spring vacation with a load of students. Another radio bulletin informs Tony, the bus driver, and the children that the creatures seem to be allergic to the sound of music. When the Globolinks threaten the bus, Tony first tries to keep them in check with the sound of the bus horn, which scares them temporarily. The students decide to try to reach the school to call for help, but most have forgotten their musical instruments, which could protect them along the way. Only Emily has remembered her violin. She is hesitant to venture out on her own, but after Tony and the other children reassure her, she bravely leaves the bus behind, playing her violin all the way.

In the Dean's office of St. Paul school, Dr. Stone and Timothy are worried about where the children could be. Madame Euterpova interrupts, complaining that the students have left their instruments behind during their spring vacation, even though they had promised to take them home to practice. Because of Dr. Stone's disregard for her music lessons, she threatens to resign. He sees teaching music as insignificant and admits that he cannot even sing himself. He dismisses her and lies down to relieve his ""splitting headache"", only to hear another radio bulletin warning that ""once you are touched by a Globolink, you lose all power of speech"" and are turned into one yourself within 24 hours. While he is asleep, the Globolinks come into the office and touch Dr. Stone. He rings the school bell to drive them away. The teachers rush in, only to find that Dr. Stone can speak only in weird, electronic sounds. As they debate what to do, Madame Euterpova appears as a savior in their time of need, and gathers the teachers along with their own musical instruments, including a drum and a tuba. They all march out of the school to locate and save the missing children.

Tony and the students are still waiting in the broken-down bus for Emily to return. The Globolinks no longer fear the sound of the horn and attack again. Just in time, the teachers arrive with their motley band of instruments, and the Globolinks disappear. Emily, who has made her way into the forest, is still missing. Dr. Stone, although almost a Globolink himself, has been taught by Madame Euterpova to sing just one note to keep them at bay. He believes he can help find Emily. They all march off following Dr. Stone as fast as they can.

Emily has lost her way in the forest. Although still playing her violin, she soon falls down in exhaustion. The Globolinks approach her while she is sleeping and break her violin. Emily screams and runs for help, only to find Dr. Stone still singing his one note. She does not understand why he looks and sounds so strange. He has lost his voice and can only stammer ""La, la"". He finally completes his transformation into a Globolink and flies away. At this moment, the teachers and students arrive and Emily is finally safe. Madame Euterpova implores everyone to always make music with their hands and breath, as ""she leads the little army away, all happily playing their instruments"".
 published a review of the 1969 New York City Center production titled ""Bleeps in the Night"". The article explores some of the themes employed in the opera and the differences between  and Menotti's 1951 opera for children, .
Menotti described the Globolinks as ""sinister, but with a touch of humor"". The electronic sound effects that are heard when the Globolinks appear sound like they are from a bad science fiction film. The creatures themselves are played for camp, not terror. The dialogue between the music teacher and the dean is played as broad farce both dramatically and vocally. Madame Euterpova often serves as Menotti's own conscience, declaring that the world has ""forgotten how to sing"". But, he also makes her somewhat ridiculous and egotistical so that she does not become too preachy. Menotti was fearful of the new wave of electronics and experimentation in music of the time, wondering whether these styles might eventually replace the drama and melody of traditional opera. To this end, the Globolinks are accompanied by bizarre electronic noises and can only be stopped by real, live music, such as Emily's violin.
The first studio recording, conducted by , was published by  in 1998.
The original Hamburg production was filmed by German television in 1969, and was released on DVD on February 27, 2007.

At the house of Kapitan Tiyago, a reception is held to celebrate the return of Crisostomo Ibarra after a 7-year stay in Europe. Among the guests was Padre Damaso, who denounced the character of the Filipino people (Indio) derisively. During a much heated conversation among the guests Crisostomo Ibarra arrives accompanied by Kapitan Tiyago. Unaware of the situation, Ibarra approached Damaso, only to be rebuffed. The sudden death of Ibarra's father continues to puzzle him, and the news of Maria Clara coming to the house mitigates his deep thoughts. Ibarra announced that he is going to build a schoolhouse to honor his father's memory.
The guests move to the dining room as Maria Clara arrives to the scene accompanied by Tiya Isabel. Ibarra rushed to welcome them. The lovers now alone reminisce on sweet memories spent together. The act ends with Ibarra remembering that  is nearing, and leaves to pay respects to his late father.
At the cemetery, two grave diggers were resting. One of them tells a story of how he exhumed a grave that is barely a month old on a stormy night. Ibarra then enters and asks for the grave of his father. One of the diggers replied that he dug the grave to put it to the Chinese Cemetery (a cemetery for heretics) by orders of a priest. This enraged Ibarra and the digger eventually told him that he had thrown the body to a river instead to the Chinese Cemetery. Ibarra leaves enraged as Pilosopo Tasyo enters, happily waiting for the upcoming storm. As the rain started to fall Pilosopo Tasyo noticed Basilio and Crispin. He said to them that they should go to their mother's house as she has prepared a wonderful dinner. However, shortly after this Crispin gets accused of theft by one of the priests and both of them are punished. Basilio escaped but is injured by a gunshot wound. Meanwhile, Sisa gets abused by two Guardia Civils.
Young people of San Diego were happily having a picnic by the shores of a lake to celebrate the return of Ibarra. During the celebrations a crocodile was spotted by the fishermen. The news caused panic among the people. Elias attempted to drive away the crocodile but is endangered. Ibarra saves him and kills the crocodile. Elias thanks Ibarra for saving him and he also warned him to be careful of his enemies. During the picnic Sisa wandered around, lamenting and finding her lost children.
While Ibarra elaborates on his plans to build a schoolhouse, Padre Damaso joins the scene and ridicules Ibarra's plans. Ibarra, greatly enraged, grabbed a knife, and approached the priest. The interference of Maria Clara and other guests stopped Ibarra from doing further injuries to the priest.
Maria Clara is seen in her bedroom depressed. The news of Ibarra getting excommunicated and banished from San Diego greatly saddened her. Tiya Isabel, Sinang and Andeng consoles her. Kapitan Tiyago enters and announced in a woeful tone about Padre Damaso's order to break the engagement between Ibarra and Maria Clara, and instead making her marry with a young Spaniard named Alfonso Linares. Ibarra meanwhile talked to the governor-general to clear his name. He went to Maria Clara's place and proposed marriage. The rejoicing of the couple is interrupted as the Alferez arrests Ibarra for allegedly inciting a rebellion. Maria Clara is in great despair and prays to the Virgin Mary for help.
In her bedroom Maria Clara is worried for Ibarra's fate. Padre Damaso tries to console her. Maria Clara said if she was not able to marry Ibarra, she would either choose death or become a nun. Padre Damaso discourages her from becoming a nun, but as the firm determination of Maria Clara became apparent to him, Padre Damaso leaves her, feeling abjectly defeated and wounded to the core as he resigns his will to the inescapable ways of God.
Elias and Ibarra has just escaped from prison, and they visited Maria Clara through a window. They said their final goodbyes and Ibarra and Elias escapes through the window. 2 gunshots were heard at the end of the scene.
Sisa is seen wandering in the forest. She has already lost her mind and still hopelessly finding her lost children. Basilio, injured, enters and finds and calls her mother. Because of her insanity, she didn't notice him. Basilio attempts to chase her mother until he became very tired. Sisa found the exhausted Basilio, and she immediately recognized him. The shock and overflowing joy is too much for her heart and she finally expires. Elias, mortally wounded, enters. He instructs Basilio to build a pyre to burn his (Elias) body and her mother to ashes. He also instructed him to dig the riches and jewelry buried nearby to use it for his studies. Elias lamented that he wouldn't see the light of tomorrow. The opera ends with Basilio gathering firewood and burning the two corpses.

Dialogues of the Carmelites,Francis Poulenc,26 January 1957,"La Scala, Milan (in Italian)",French,1957,Poulenc," () is an  in three acts, divided into twelve scenes with linking orchestral interludes, with music and libretto by , completed in 1956. The composer's second opera, Poulenc wrote the libretto after the work of the same name by . The opera tells a fictionalised version of the story of the ,  who, in 1794 during the closing days of the  during the French Revolution, were guillotined in Paris for refusing to renounce their vocation.
The world première of the opera occurred (in  translation) on 26 January 1957 at  in Milan.  The première of the French-language version took place in  on 21 June 1957.  The United States première, in English, followed in  in September 1957.
Bernanos had been hired in 1947 to write the dialogue for a film screenplay, through Raymond-Léopold Bruckberger and the scenario writer Philippe Agostini, based on the novella  (literal translation,  or , the published title of the English translation) by .  The novella is based on the story of the  at the  of  nuns in , northern France, in the wake of the , specifically in 1794 at the time of state seizure of the monastery's assets. It traces a fictional path from 1789 up to these events, when nuns of the Carmelite Order were .
The screenplay was judged unsatisfactory for a film.  Bernanos died on 5 July 1948.  Subsequently, his literary executor, Albert Béguin, found this manuscript.  To assist Bernanos' surviving family, Béguin sought to have the work published, and requested permission from von Le Fort for publication.  In January 1949, she agreed, and donated her portion of the royalties due to her, as creator of the original story, over to Bernanos' widow and children.  However, von Le Fort requested that the Bernanos work be titled differently from her own novella.  Béguin chose  as the title for the Bernanos work, which was published in 1949.  A German translation of the work,  (), was published in 1951, and Zurich and Munich saw productions of  that year.  The French stage premiere was by Jacques Hébertot in May 1952 at the .
The genesis of the opera was in 1953.  took her husband, president of Ricordi, which was Poulenc's publishing firm, to see the Bernanos play in Vienna. She had asked Poulenc to write an oratorio for her; through the commission from Ricordi, he developed the work as the opera. Wallman was the eventual producer of the La Scala première of Poulenc's opera, and she later supervised the 1983 revival at Covent Garden. About the same time, M. Valcarenghi had approached Poulenc with a commission for a ballet for  in .
Separately, Poulenc had seen the Bernanos play, but the suggestion from  finalised the impetus to adapt the subject as an opera.  Poulenc began to adapt the Bernanos text in the spring and summer of 1953, and to compose the music in August 1953.  In October 1953, Poulenc learned of a literary rights dispute between Béguin and the American writer , who had previously secured all rights to theatrical adaptations of von Le Fort's novel from her in April–May 1949.  This was independent of the discussion, concluded in January 1949, between Béguin and von Le Fort.  The two-year literary rights dispute between Béguin and Lavery reached arbitration by a jury from  in Paris.  On 20 July 1954, this jury ruled unanimously for Lavery, and ordered the Bernanos heirs to pay Lavery 100,000 FF for past contract infringements.  In addition, the ruling required the Bernanos heirs to pay Lavery, with respect to all future productions of , 15% of the royalties from English-language productions, and 10% from productions in all other languages.
Poulenc had curtailed work on his opera in March 1954, in light of his understanding of the Béguin-Lavery dispute.  Following the July 1954 decision, separate negotiations occurred between Béguin and Lavery, via his agent Marie Schebeko, on rights and royalties to allow Poulenc to write his opera.  The formal agreement was dated 30 March 1955, and acknowledged Bernanos, Lavery, von Le Fort, Bruckberger, and Agostini.  The terms stipulated that the Poulenc opera was adapted from Bernanos 'with the authorization of Monsieur Emmet Lavery', with Lavery listed in the credits after Bernanos and before von Le Fort, without any contribution of material by Lavery to the libretto.  Poulenc then resumed work on the opera, and completed it October 1955.
At this time, Poulenc had recommitted himself to spirituality and Roman Catholicism, although he was openly gay and the church officially opposed homosexuality. Opera critic  believes that Poulenc's concerns for the travails of post-World War II France, as it tried to reconcile issues related to the Holocaust, German occupation and the Resistance, was a subtext within the opera. Wallmann worked closely with Poulenc during the composition process and in evolving the structure, as well as later when she re-staged the production in other theatres.  The libretto is unusually deep in its psychological study of the contrasting characters of Mother Marie de l'Incarnation and Blanche de la Force.   describes Bernanos' text as ""concise and clear"" and that like ""all good librettos it suggests far more than it states"".
Poulenc set his libretto largely in .  His own religious devotions are particularly evident in the  setting of  in Act II, Scene II, and the  in Act II, Scene IV. During the final tableau of the opera, which takes place in the , the distinct sound of the 's descending blade is heard repeatedly over the orchestra and the singing of the nuns, who are taken one by one, until only Soeur Constance and Blanche de la Force remain.
Poulenc acknowledged his debt to , , , and  in his dedication of the opera, with the casual remark:
Music critic  has commented on the opera:
Opera historian  wrote:
Philip Hensher has commented on the unique place of this opera in its depiction of convent life:
Poulenc expressed a general wish that the opera be performed in the vernacular of the local audience.  Thus the opera was first performed in an Italian translation at  on 26 January 1957, with Romanian soprano  in the role of Blanche.  The original French version premiered on 21 June that year by the Théâtre National de l'Opéra de Paris (the current ), where Poulenc had chosen the Paris cast, which included Denise Duval (Blanche de la Force), Régine Crespin (Madame Lidoine), Rita Gorr (Mother Marie), and Liliane Berton (Sister Constance).
The United States premiere took place three months later, on 20 September, in English, at , which featured the opera stage debut of  (as Madame Lidoine).  The opera was first presented in New York City on 3 March 1966, in a staging by .  The  first staged the opera in 1977, in a production by , sung in the English translation of Joseph Machlis.  The 1980 revival of this production utilised the original French text.  Subsequent performances, until 2013, were generally sung in the English translation. The 2013 revivals of this production used the original French text, with another production undertaken in 2019, included as part of the Live in HD cinema series for that season.
The opera is among a comparatively small number of post-Puccini works that has never lost its place in the international repertory.
The opera opens with Marquis and Chevalier de la Force talking about the general unrest in France and their worries about Blanche, at a time when crowds stop carriages in the street and aristocrats are attacked. The pathologically timid Blanche de la Force decides to retreat from the world and enter a Carmelite convent. The Mother Superior informs her that the Carmelite Order is not a refuge; it is the duty of the nuns to guard the Order, not the other way around. In the convent, the chatterbox Sister Constance tells Blanche (to her consternation) that she has had a dream that the two of them will die young together. The prioress, who is dying, commits Blanche to the care of Mother Marie. The Mother Superior passes away in great agony, shouting in her delirium that despite her long years of service to God, He has abandoned her. Blanche and Mother Marie, who witness her death, are shaken.
Sister Constance remarks to Blanche that the prioress' death seemed unworthy of her, and speculates that she had been given the wrong death, as one might be given the wrong coat in a cloakroom. She said that perhaps someone else will find death surprisingly easy. Perhaps we die not for ourselves alone, but for each other.
Blanche's brother, the Chevalier de la Force, arrives to announce that their father thinks Blanche should withdraw from the convent, since she is not safe there (being both an aristocrat and the member of a religious community, at a time of anti-aristocracy and anti-clericalism in the rising revolutionary tides). Blanche refuses, saying that she has found happiness in the Carmelite Order. Later she admits to Mother Marie that it is fear (or the fear of fear itself, as the Chevalier expresses it) that keeps her from leaving.
The chaplain announces that he has been forbidden to preach (presumably for being a non-juror under the ). The nuns remark on how fear rules the country, and no one has the courage to stand up for the priests. Sister Constance asks, ""Are there no men left to come to the aid of the country?"" ""When priests are lacking, martyrs are superabundant,"" replies the new Mother Superior. Mother Marie says that the Carmelites can save France by giving their lives, but the Mother Superior corrects her: it is not permitted to choose to become a martyr; God decides who will be martyred.
A police officer arrives and announces to the community that the  has  the convent and its property, and the nuns must give up their . When Mother Marie acquiesces, the officer taunts her for being eager to dress like everyone else. She replies that the nuns will continue to serve, no matter how they are dressed. ""The people have no need of servants,"" proclaims the officer haughtily. ""No, but they have a great need for martyrs,"" responds Mother Marie. ""In times like these, death is nothing,"" he says. ""Life is nothing,"" she answers, ""when it is so debased.""
In the absence of the new prioress, Mother Marie proposes that the nuns take a vow of martyrdom. However, all must agree, or Mother Marie will not insist. A secret vote is held; there is one dissenting voice. Sister Constance declares that she was the dissenter, and that she has changed her mind, so the vow can proceed. Blanche runs away from the convent, and Mother Marie goes to look for her, finding her in her father's library. Her father has been guillotined, and Blanche has been forced to serve her former servants.
The nuns are all arrested and condemned to death, but Mother Marie is away at the time of the arrest. Upon receiving the news, the chaplain tells Mother Marie, when they meet again, that since God has chosen to spare her, she cannot voluntarily become a martyr by joining the others in prison.
At the place of execution, one nun after another stands and slowly processes toward the guillotine, as all sing the """" (""Hail, Holy Queen""). At the last moment, Blanche appears, to Constance's joy, to join her condemned sisters. Having seen all the other nuns executed, as she mounts the scaffold, Blanche sings the final stanza of the "","" , the Catholic hymn traditionally used when taking vows in a religious community and offering one's life to God.

Noye's Fludde,Benjamin Britten,18 June 1958,"St Bartholomew's Church, Orford (Aldeburgh Festival)",English,1957,," is a one-act opera  by the British composer , intended primarily for amateur performers, particularly children. First performed on 18 June 1958 at that year's , it is based on the 15th-century  which recounts the  story of . Britten specified that the opera should be staged in churches or large halls, not in a theatre.
By the mid-1950s Britten had established himself as a major composer, both of operas and of works for mixed professional and amateur forces – his mini-opera  (1949) was written for young audiences, and used child performers. He had previously adapted text from the Chester play cycle in his 1952 , which retells .  was composed as a project for television; to the Chester text Britten added three congregational hymns, the Greek prayer  as a children's chant, and an  chorus. A large children's chorus represents the pairs of animals who march into and out of the ark, and proceedings are directed by the spoken Voice of God. Of the solo sung roles, only the parts of Noye (Noah) and his wife were written to be sung by professionals; the remaining roles are for child and adolescent performers. A small professional ensemble underpins the mainly amateur orchestra which  contains numerous unconventional instruments  to provide particular musical effects; bugle fanfares for the animals, handbell chimes for the rainbow, and various improvisations to replicate musically the sounds of a storm.
At its premiere  was acclaimed by critics and public alike, both for the inspiration of the music and the brilliance of the design and production. The opera received its American premiere in New York in March 1959, and its first German performance at  in May of that year. Since then it has been staged worldwide; the performance in Beijing in October 2012 organised by the KT Wong Foundation was the first in China of any Britten opera. The occasion of Britten's centenary in 2013 led to numerous productions at music festivals, both in the UK and abroad.
English  were dramatised  stories, by ancient tradition performed on Church  in town squares and market places  by members of the town's craft guilds. They covered the full range of the narrative and metaphor in the  Bible, from the  to the . From the many play cycles that originated in the late , the  is one of four that has survived into the 21st century. The texts, by an unidentified writer, were revised during the late 15th century  into a format similar to that of contemporary French passion plays, and were published in 1890, in 's .
The story of Noah and the flood, the third play in the Chester cycle, was originally performed by the city's Guild of the Drawers of Dee, otherwise known as the water-carriers. A feature of this play, observed by the historian , is the depiction of Noah's wife, and by implication women generally, as disobedient, obdurate and finally abusive, in contrast to the ""grave and obedient"" Noah and his patient sons.
By the latter part of the 16th-century , the Church had grown less tolerant of mystery plays. A performance in Chester in 1575 is the last recorded from the city until the 20th century, when the Chester cycle was revived under the supervision of Christopher Ede, as part of the city's  celebrations in June 1951. This production was received enthusiastically, and was repeated the following year; thereafter it became a regular feature and tourist attraction.
By the late 1940s  had established himself as a leading composer of English opera, with several major works to his credit. In 1947 he suggested to his librettist  that they should create a children's opera, based on a bible story. Crozier gave Britten a copy of Pollard's book, as a possible source of material. Nothing came of this project immediately; instead, Britten and Crozier wrote the   (1948), the first of several works in which Britten combined skilled performers with amateurs. The cantata involves at least two children's choirs, and incorporates two congregational hymns sung by the audience. Britten also used this fusion of professional with amateur forces in  (1949), which forms the second part of his entertainment for children, , that he devised with Crozier. Again, child singers (also doubling as actors) were used, and the audience sings choruses at appropriate points. In 1952, although Britten's collaboration with Crozier had ended, he used the Chester plays book as the source text for his , based on the story of  and .
In April 1957 , Head of Schools Broadcasting at  (A-R), wrote to Britten, proposing a series of half-hour programmes. These would show Britten composing and rehearsing a work through to its performance, and would provide children with ""an intimate piece of musical education, by ... watching a piece of music take shape and in some degree growing with it"". Britten was initially cautious; he found the idea interesting but, he warned Ford, he was at that time  busy  travelling, and had little time for writing. He was also anxious not to cover the same ground as he had with . However, he agreed to meet Ford  to discuss the project further. On 11 July they met in London, together with Britten's musical assistant . Britten told Ford that he had ""for some months or a year vaguely been thinking of doing something with the [Chester] miracle plays"", and agreed to write an opera for A-R's 1958 summer term of school programmes. The subject would be Noah and the flood, based on the Chester text. Later, Ford and his script editor, Martin Worth, travelled to Aldeburgh, and with Britten looked at possible churches for the performance. , was chosen as, unlike most other churches in East Suffolk, its pews were not fixed, thus offering a more flexible performing space.
After the opening congregational hymn ""Lord Jesus, think on me"", the spoken Voice of God addresses Noye, announcing the forthcoming destruction of the sinful world. God tells Noye to build an  (""a shippe"") that will provide salvation for him and his family. Noye agrees, and calls on the people and his family to help. His sons and their wives enter with tools and materials and begin work, while Mrs Noye and her Gossips (close friends) mock the project.
When the ark is completed, Noye tries to persuade his wife to enter: ""Wyffe, in this vessel we shall be kepte"", but she refuses, and they quarrel. The Voice of God foretells forty days and forty nights of rain, and instructs Noye to fill the ark with animals of every kind. The animals enter the ark in pairs, while Noye's sons and their wives provide a commentary. Noye orders his family to board the ark; again Mrs Noye and the Gossips refuse, preferring to carouse. The sons finally drag Mrs Noye on board, while the Gossips are swept away by the encroaching flood; she rewards her husband with a slap. Rain begins to fall, building to a great storm at the height of which the first verse of the naval hymn """" is heard from the ark. The congregation joins in the second and third verses of the hymn, during which the storm gradually subsides. When it is calm, Noye sends out a Raven, saying ""If this foule come not againe/it is a signe soth to sayne/that dry it is on hill or playne."" When the Raven fails to return, Noye knows that the bird has discovered dry land. He sends out a Dove, who eventually brings back an olive branch. Noah accepts this as a sign of deliverance, and thanks God.
The Voice of God instructs everyone to leave the ark. As they do, the animals sing ""Alleluias"" and the people sing a chorus of praise: ""Lord we thanke thee through thy mighte"". God promises that he will never again destroy the earth with water, and produces a rainbow as his token. The cast begins Addison's hymn ""The spacious firmament on high"", with the congregation joining in the last two verses. All the cast depart except Noye, who receives God's blessing and promise of no more vengeance: ""And nowe fare well, my darling deare"" before his departure from the stage.
Britten began detailed planning for the opera in August 1957, while sailing to Canada for a tour with the . He told , at that time the EOG's stage manager, that he wanted him to direct the new work. After a further meeting at Associated Rediffusion's London headquarters on 18 October, Britten began a composition draft in Aldeburgh on 27 October. To Pollard's edition of the Noah play's text, he added three congregational Anglican hymns: ""Lord Jesus, think on me""; ""Eternal Father, strong to save""; and ""The spacious firmament on high"". Britten introduced the repetitive Greek chant """" (""Lord, have mercy"") at the entry of the animals, and ""Alleluias"" at their triumphant exit. He had completed about two-thirds of the opera when Ford was dismissed from A-R, allegedly for administrative shortcomings and inexperience. A-R  decided to withdraw from the project, which was then taken up by  (ATV), whose chairman  personally took responsibility for signing the contract and urged that Britten should complete the opera.
In November 1957 Britten moved to , but continued to work on the opera throughout the upheaval. According to a letter he wrote to  on 14 December, ""the final bars of the opera [were] punctuated by hammer-blows"" from workmen busy at the Red House. Before he finished the composition draft, Britten wrote to the baritone , who had sung in several previous Britten operas, asking if he would take the title role. Britten completed the full score of the opera in March 1958, which he dedicated ""To my nephew and nieces, Sebastian, Sally and Roguey Welford, and my young friend Ronald Duncan [one of Britten's godsons]"".
With the wide variety of child performers required in the opera, and in light of how it was cast and performed at its premiere, Britten detailed some of its specific requirements for performance in the vocal and study scores published by . The opera is intended for a large hall or church, not a theatre. The action should take place on raised rostra, though not on a formal stage set apart from the audience, and the orchestra should be placed in full sight, with the conductor in a position to conduct both the orchestra and, when performing the hymns, the congregation. Noye and Mrs Noye are sung by ""accomplished singer-actors"", and the Voice of God, although not necessarily a professional actor, should have ""a rich speaking voice, with a simple and sincere delivery, without being at all 'stagey"". The young amateurs playing the parts of Noye's children should be between 11 and 15 years old, with ""well-trained voices and lively personalities""; Jaffet, the eldest, could have a broken voice. Mrs Noye's Gossips should be older girls with strong voices and considerable acting ability. The children playing the animals should vary in size, and range in age from seven to eighteen. The older age groups, with perhaps some broken voices, should represent the larger animals (lions, leopards, horses, camels etc.), while the younger play rats, mice and birds. There is a dance or ballet involving two child performers playing the roles of the raven and the dove.
For the first time in any of his works involving amateurs, Britten envisaged a large complement of child performers among his orchestral forces, led by what Graham described as ""the professional stiffening"" of a piano duet, string quintet (two violins, viola, cello and bass), recorder and a timpanist. The young musicians play a variety of instruments, including a full string ensemble with each section led by a member of the professional string quintet. The violins are further divided into parts of different levels of difficulty, from the simplest (mostly playing open strings) to those able to play in . The recorders should be led by an accomplished soloist able to ; bugles, played in the original production by boys from a local school band, are played as the children representing animals march into the ark, and at the climax of the opera. The child percussionists, led by a professional timpanist, play various exotic and invented percussion instruments: the score itself specifies sandpaper (""two pieces of sandpaper attached to blocks of wood and rubbed together""), and ""Slung Mugs"", the latter used to represent the first drops of rain. Britten originally had the idea of striking teacups with a spoon, but having failed to make this work, he sought Imogen Holst's advice. She recalled that ""by great good fortune I had once had to teach Women's Institute percussion groups during a wartime 'social half hour', so I was able to take him into my kitchen and show him how a row of china mugs hanging on a length of string could be hit with a large wooden spoon.
Britten also added – relatively late in the process of scoring the work – an ensemble of handbell ringers. According to Imogen Holst, a member of the Aldeburgh Youth Club brought Britten's attention to a local group of  bellringers; hearing them play, Britten was so enchanted by the sound that he gave the ensemble a major part to play as the rainbow unfolds towards the end of the opera. Several commentators, including ,  and , have noted the affinity between the sound of Britten's use of the handbells and the gamelan ensembles he had heard first-hand in Bali in 1956. The scarcity of handbells tuned at several of the pitches required by Britten in the opera was to become an issue when the score was being prepared for publication.
The first performance of  was staged during the 1958 Aldeburgh Festival, at , on 18 June. The conductor was Charles Mackerras, who had participated in several productions at past Aldeburgh festivals. The production was directed by  Colin Graham, who also designed its set, with costume designs by .
Apart from Brannigan as Noye, two other professional singers were engaged: Gladys Parr, in her last role before retirement, sang the part of Mrs Noye, and the spoken Voice of God was provided by the Welsh bass Trevor Anthony. The other major roles were taken by child soloists, who were selected from extensive auditions. Among these was the future actor-singer, , then 16 years old and described by Graham as ""a very recently broken-voiced young tenor"", who played the role of Jaffet. Mrs Noye's Gossips were originally to be performed by girls from a Suffolk school, but when the headmistress heard rumours about the ""dissolute"" parts they were to play, she withdrew her pupils.
The professional element in the orchestra was provided by the English Opera Group players, led by , with    at the organ. The children players, billed as ""An East Suffolk Children's Orchestra"", included handbell ringers from the County Modern School, Leiston; a percussion group, whose instruments included the slung mugs, from ; recorder players from ; and bugle players from the , Holbrook. Graham, recalling the premiere some years later, wrote: ""The large orchestra (originally 150 players) ... were massed around the font of Orford Church while the opera was played out on a stage erected at the end of the nave."" , writing for , observed that ""Charles Mackerras conducted the widespread forces, actually moving round a pillar to be able to control all sections in turn.""  of  noted: ""The white walls of Orford Church furnished an ideal background to the gay colours of Ceri Richards's costumes and the fantastic head-dresses of the animals. In fact, the future of the work will lie in village churches such as this and with amateur musicians, for whom Britten has written something both wholly new and outstandingly original.""
The general critical reception was warmly enthusiastic.  in  called the performance ""a curiously moving spiritual and musical experience"". Eric Roseberry, writing in  magazine, found the music ""simple and memorably tuneful throughout ... the writing for strings, recorders and percussion is a miracle of inspiration"".  in  magazine  also found the music touched ""by high inspiration""; the evening was ""an unforgettable experience ... extraordinarily beautiful, vivid and charming, and often deeply moving"". The design and production, Porter reported, were ""brilliant"", while Mackerras commanded his disparate forces masterfully. Several critics remarked favourably on the sound of the handbells. s critic noted the effectiveness of Britten's setting of the mystery play: ""It is Britten's triumph that in this musically slender piece he has brought to new life the mentality of another century by wholly modern means. These means included a miscellaneous orchestra such as he alone could conceive and handle"".
After the premiere, there were two further performances by the same forces in Orford Church, on 19 and 21 June.  became the first of Britten's operas to be shown on television, when it was broadcast by ATV on 22 June 1958.
 had been largely created according to the resources available from the local Suffolk community. However,  once Britten witnessed the public and critical reception following the premiere, he insisted on taking it to London. Looking for a suitable London church, Britten settled on , somewhat reluctantly as he felt that it did not compare favourably with Orford. Four performances featuring the same principals as the premiere were given, on 14 and 15 November 1958, with Britten conducting the first. All four performances sold out on the first day of booking, even, as Britten told a friend, ""before any advertisement & with 2000 circulars yet to be sent!!"" On 24 and 25 April 1959 the  , which was formed in 1958 specially to perform , gave what was billed as ""the  first amateur London performance"" of the work,  at All Saint's Church, Finchley; the cast included the operatic bass  as Noah.
In the United States, after a radio broadcast in New York City on 31 July 1958, the School of Sacred Music of  staged the US premiere on 16 March 1959. The following year saw the opera's Canadian premiere, conducted by , staged during the 1960 Vancouver International Festival in .
During preparations  for the first German performance of  in , planned for May 1959, the problem of the scarcity of handbells  became acute. Britten suggested that in the absence of handbells a set of tubular bells in E flat in groups of twos and threes could be played by four or six children with two hammers each to enable them to strike the chords. Britten was not present in Ettal, but he learned from , of Boosey & Hawkes, that the Ettal production had substituted glockenspiel and metallophone for the handbells; according to Roth the bells in 's  percussion ensembles were ""too weak"" for the purpose. Britten later wrote to a friend: ""I am rather relieved that I wasn't there! – no church, no bugles, no handbells, no recorders – but they seem to have done it with a great deal of care all the same. Still I rather hanker after doing it in Darmstadt as we want it – even importing handbells for instance.""
In the UK, Christopher Ede, producer of the landmark performances of the Chester mystery plays during the Festival of Britain, directed Britten's opera in Winchester Cathedral, 12–14 July 1960. Writing to Ede on 19 December 1959, Britten urged him to keep the staging of  simple rather than elaborate. In 1971 the Aldeburgh Festival once again staged  at Orford; a full television broadcast of the production, transferred to , was made by the BBC, conducted by  under the composer's supervision, with Brannigan resuming the role of Noah, Sheila Rex as his wife, and   Lumsden as the Voice of God.
In 1972  directed his first opera with a production of , staged during 21–23 December at the , London. The adult roles were taken by  (God),  (Noah) and  (Mrs Noah), and the conductor was .
Among less conventional productions, in September 2005  was performed at Nuremberg zoo, in a production by the Internationales Kammermusikfestival Nürnberg involving around 180 children from Nuremberg and from England, directed by Nina Kühner, conducted by Peter Selwyn. A subsequent zoo production was presented  in , Northern Ireland, by  and the KT Wong Foundation. The performance was directed by  and conducted by , with  as Noye and Doreen Curran as Mrs Noye. The same production was performed in China, in October 2012, at the Beijing Music Festival, this being the Chinese premiere of the work, and the first full performance of a Britten opera in China. It was performed again at the Shanghai Music In The Summer Air (MISA) Festival in July 2013.
A performance is a minor plot point in the 2012 movie .
Britten's centenary year 2013 prompted numerous performances across the UK, including at  during the , and the  where 120 local children appeared as the animals. An  production as a finale to the centenary year was staged in November, on the eve of Britten's 100th birthday anniversary, in his home town of .    appeared as Noye, and  as Mrs Noye. It was directed by  and broadcast in the UK on  on 24 November. Outside the UK, several professional companies mounted  centenary year productions involving local children, including the , and the   which mounted its first production of any Britten opera.
 has been described by the musicologist  as a forerunner of Britten's church parables of the 1960s, and by the composer's biographer  as a hybrid work, ""as much a cantata as an opera"". Most of the orchestral writing, says the music analyst Eric Roseberry, lies ""well within the range of intelligent young players of very restricted technique"". Several episodes of the opera – such as ""the grinding conflict of Britten's  theme against Dykes's familiar hymn-tune in the storm"" – introduces listeners and the youthful performers to what Roseberry terms ""a contemporary idiom of dissonance"", in contrast to the ""outworn style"" of most music written for the young. With its innovatory arrangement of vocal and instrumental forces,  is summarised by Whittall as ""a brilliant demonstration of how to combine the relatively elementary instrumental and vocal skills of amateurs with professionals to produce a highly effective piece of music theatre.""
The opera begins with a short, ""strenuous"" instrumental prelude, which forms the basis of the musical accompaniment to the opening congregational hymn; its first phrase is founded on a descending bass E-B-F, itself to become an important motif.  notes that throughout the hymn the bass line is out of step with the singing, an effect which, he says, ""suggests an adult world where purity is unattainable"". Following the hymn, the Voice of God is accompanied, as it is in all his pre-flood warnings and declamations, by the E-B-F notes from the opera's opening bass line, sounded on the timpani. After Noye's response in recitative, the next musical episode is the entry of Noye's children and their wives, a passage which, Carpenter suggests, replaces the pessimism of the adult word with ""the blissful optimism of childhood"". The syncopated tune of the children's song is derived from the final line of Noye's recitative: ""As God has bidden us doe"".
Mrs Noye and her Gossips enter to an F sharp minor distortion of the children's tune, which reflects their mocking attitude. In Noye's song calling for the ark to be built, a flood  derived from the first line of the opening hymn recurs as a solemn refrain. The music which accompanies the construction work heavily involves the children's orchestra, and includes recorder trills, pizzicato open strings, and the tapping of oriental temple-blocks. After the brief ""quarrel"" duet between Noye and his wife in , timpani-led percussion heralds the Voice of God's order to fill the ark. Bugle fanfares  announce the arrival of the animals, who march into the ark to a ""jauntily innocent"" tune in which Roseberry detects the spirit of ; the fanfares punctuate the entire march. The birds are the last group to enter the ark, to the accompaniment of a three-part  sung by Noye's children and their wives. In the final scene before the storm, where Noye and his family try to persuade Mrs Noye to join them in the ark in G major, the music expresses Mrs Noye's obstinacy by having her reply accompanied by a D sharp  which prepares for the Gossips' drinking scherzo in E minor. The slap which Mrs Noye administers when finally persuaded is accompanied by an E major fortissimo.
The storm scene which forms the centre of the opera is an extended passacaglia, the theme of which uses the entire . In a long instrumental introduction, full rein is given to the various elements of the children's orchestra. Slung mugs struck with a wooden spoon give the sound of the first raindrops. Trills in the recorders represent the wind, strings impersonate waves, while  piano chords outline the flood leitmotiv. The sound builds to a peak with thunder and lightning from the percussion. When ""Eternal Father"" is sung at the climax of the storm, the passacaglia theme provides the bass line for the hymn. After the hymn, the minor-key fury of the passacaglia gradually subsides, resolving into what Roseberry describes as ""a dewy, pastoral F major"" akin to that of the finale of . Noye's reappearance is followed by the brief waltzes for the Raven, accompanied by solo cello, and the Dove, the latter a flutter-tongued recorder solo the melody of which is reversed when the Dove returns.
Following God's instruction, the people and animals leave the ark singing a thankful chorus of Alleluias with more bugle fanfares in B flat. The appearance of the rainbow is accompanied by handbell chimes, a sound which dominates the final stages of the work. In the final canonical hymn, the main tune moves from F major to G major and is sung over reiterated bugle calls, joined by the handbells. In the third verse, the organ provides a brief discordant intervention, ""the one jarring note in "" according to the musicologist . Graham Elliott believes that this may be a musical joke in which Britten pokes gentle fun at the habits of some church organists. The mingled chimes of slung mugs and bells continue during God's final valedictory blessing. As Noye leaves, the full orchestra provides a final fortissimo salute, the opera then concluding peacefully with B flat chimes of handbells alternating with extended G major string chords – ""a hauntingly beautiful close"", says Roseberry.
Several of the opera's novel features, including the use of a large amateur orchestra, and specifically its use of handbells, posed problems for Britten's publishers, .  made enquiries about the availability of handbells to the firm Mears & Stainbank (the ), and then wrote to Britten urging him to prepare an alternative, simplified version of  for publication, since the rarity of handbells in the scale of E flat made the original score, in his view, impractical. Britten resisted such a proposal: ""I think if you consider a performance of this work in a big church with about fifty or more children singing, you will agree that the orchestra would sound totally inadequate if it were only piano duet, a few strings and a drum or two."" Britten suggested, rather, that Boosey & Hawkes should invest in a set of E flat handbells to hire for performances; or, that the handbells music could be simply cued in the piano duet part.
After the score had been published, and in the face of an imminent performance in Ettal, Britten suggested that he could attempt to rewrite the music for a handbell ensemble in D, since sets in that key were more common than in E flat. Britten never prepared this alternative version for reduced instrumentation. He did agree, however, to make the published full score ""less bulky"" by presenting the amateur forces of recorders, ripieno strings and percussion in the form of short score, on the understanding that full scores for those groups would be available to hire for rehearsal and performance purposes. The full score was published in 1958, and the vocal score, prepared by Imogen Holst with the libretto translated into German by Prince Ludwig of Hesse and the Rhine,  under the pseudonym Ludwig Landgraf, was published in 1959.

Vanessa,Samuel Barber,"January 15, 1958","Metropolitan Opera, New York",English,1958,Gian Carlo Menotti," is an American  in three (originally four) acts by , opus 32, with an original English  by .  It was composed in 1956–1957 and was first performed at the  in New York City on January 15, 1958 under the baton of  in a production designed by  and directed by Menotti.  Barber revised the opera in 1964, reducing the four acts to the three-act version most commonly performed today.
For the Met premiere,  was contracted to sing the title role. However, she cancelled six weeks before the opening night and  replaced her, making the role her own for a long time.  In the role of Erika, Vanessa's niece, was , then a young .  sang the lover Anatol, mezzo  sang the Baroness, Vanessa's mother, while bass  sang the old doctor. It was the first American opera in 11 years to be seen at the company, and only the 20th in 73 years.
The premiere ""was an unqualified success with the audience and with many of the critics as well although they were somewhat qualified in their judgment. Of the final quintet, however,  critic  said it is '...a full-blown set-piece that packs an emotional charge and that would be a credit to any composer anywhere today.' "".  Other reports substantiate this and it won Barber the . The original production was shown at the  in the same year, which was the first performance in Europe. In Europe, however, it met with a chillier reception.
The Met's Cecil Beaton sets were destroyed by fire in 1973. After a long period of few revivals, one being in 1988 by the , the  (in a co-production with the ) revived the work in 1995 using the 1964 revised and more compact version. Elizabeth Holleque sang the title role.
 sang the title role in three revivals, the first of which was presented by the  in 2001, the second in 2002 at the Washington National Opera and the third in 2004 (at the time, described as her farewell to the opera stage), at the .
In all three productions, Rosalind Elias, who sang Erika in the 1958 premiere, took on the role of the Baroness. For its 50th anniversary revival by the  in November 2007, she was once more featured in that role, with  taking the title role.
Highlights from the score include the soprano scena and   (recorded by  and ), the mezzo aria  (recorded by ), and the last-act quintet, .
In many print media it says that the libretto of Gian Carlo Menotti is based on a work of  (pen name of Karen Blixen), described variously as a ""short story"" or ""novella"". However, the story is not found in any of Isak Dinesen's works. There is evidence of Samuel Barber's having read Blixen's , and the mistaking of the proper source may have come from a proclamation by Menotti and Barber, that the opera reproduced the ""atmosphere"" of Isak Dinesen's  ""Menotti recalled, 'I was writing a libretto for Sam, and Sam is essentially a romantic personality...'"" Menotti was ""inspired by Isak Dinesen's stories, in particular her  He said, 'I felt that the atmosphere... would make a wonderful opera.'""
Blixen was present at the premiere of the opera, but part way through the performance she pleaded illness and left the theater. Her secretary wrote that Barber was ""upset"" by Blixen's premature departure from the opera.  Blixen made no public comment.
In her secluded country house, Vanessa awaits the arrival of Anatol, a man who had been Vanessa's lover twenty years before. After he left, she covered up all the mirrors of the house until his expected return, unwilling to face looking at her aging self. She lives alone with her mother, the Baroness, who has refused to speak to her for twenty years, and with her niece, Erika.  Thinking that the man who arrives and who is called Anatol is her former lover, Vanessa refuses to reveal her face to him until he says he still loves her. He says that he does, but she does not recognize him. It is the young Anatol who has come, his father now dead.  Upset, Vanessa leaves the room, and Erika and Anatol now enjoy the meal and wine meant for Vanessa and his father.
Erika tells the Baroness that the young Anatol seduced her on his first night in the house and the Baroness scolds her.  Erika has fallen in love with Anatol, but resists his marriage proposal because she doubts his sincerity.  Not knowing that Erika loves the young man and in her delusionary state of mind, Vanessa tells her niece that she still loves him, despite Erika's warning that he is not her former lover.  The Baroness tells Erika to fight for Anatol.  She is unsure if he is worthy of her efforts. Again, he proposes, and, again, she declines.
The doctor is drunk at a New Year's Eve ball.  The Baroness and Erika refuse to come to the party to hear his announcement of Anatol and Vanessa's engagement. The doctor goes to fetch them, while Vanessa tells Anatol her fears.  Finally Erika, who, unbeknownst to everyone else, is pregnant, comes downstairs, but faints, clutching her stomach, while the doctor is making the announcement.  She recovers and flees into the freezing weather in order to cause herself to miscarry.  (In the original she says, ""His child!  It must not be born!"" which makes clear her motivation for going out into the cold, but this line is dropped in the revision.)
Vanessa is happy when Erika is found alive, and she asks Anatol why Erika is acting so strangely and whether he thinks that she loves him.  He explains that she does not.  Continuing in her delusionary state, Vanessa begs Anatol to take her away.  Meanwhile, Erika confesses to the Baroness that she had been pregnant, but is no longer. The Baroness, horrified, refuses to speak to her.
As Vanessa and Anatol finalize their preparations to move to , Vanessa asks Erika why she ran away.  The niece replies that she was just being foolish, and Vanessa says she may never come back to the house where she has been living. After the couple leaves, Erika covers the mirrors and closes up the house, just as Vanessa had done before her. She says that it is now her turn to wait.

She also wrote the libretto which was adapted from 's English translation of Thomas Mann's novella, . It was a commission from the  and premiered on 3 April 1954 at the Columbia Auditorium in .

During a fraught episode in a temple to , each of the male protagonists beheads himself. Kali brings them back to life but with the heads on the wrong bodies. Living with the mix-up ultimately results in Shridaman and Nanda committing suicide again and Sita throwing herself on their joint funeral pyre.
 was Glanville-Hicks's first attempt at a full length opera. It was the result of a $4000 commission from the  with extra funding from the Rockefeller Foundation. She wrote the libretto herself, by her own admission basing it virtually verbatim on 's English translation of Thomas Mann's 1940 novella, . However, she shortened it considerably and eliminated some elements of the plot. Despite the ostensibly tragic nature of Mann's story, he told it in a tongue-in-cheek manner. Glanville-Hicks retained some of that element by making the guru Kamadamana and the goddess Kali comic figures and giving them speaking rather than singing roles.
Glanville-Hicks wrote in the programme notes for the premiere:
The score incorporates music from her 1935  and from Indian folk sources. According to Glanville-Hicks the use of Indian musical motifs did not require a significant change in her usual mode of composition:
She composed the score over a period of four months, completing it in September 1953 in , Jamaica. While she was looking for a permanent summer house there, 's father  let her use his son's yacht  for her composing. During that time Glanville-Hicks and Theodore Flynn became lovers, and she dedicated  to him. In the course of the opera's development, she had vacillated between structures of one, two, or three acts. She eventually settled on one act with six scenes. The total running time of the opera without intermissions is approximately 75 minutes.

Setting: Rural India in mythical times

Shridaman is a learned merchant with a noble face but a thin, weedy body. Nanda is a blacksmith with a strong and beautiful body but a rather ordinary intellect. Despite these differences, they are both friends. While out in the forest, they observe the beautiful Sita taking a ritual bath. Both are immediately smitten.

Several days later, Nanda finds Shridaman literally sick with love for Sita and despairing that she will ever marry him. Nanda volunteers to woo her on Shridaman's behalf and is successful.

Shridaman and Sita's wedding is celebrated in her village with much singing and dancing.

Shridaman, Sita, and Nanda journey home together after the wedding. Shridaman has noticed that Sita and Nanda have a strong attraction to each other. As they are passing through the forest, they come upon a temple to the goddess Kali. Shridaman goes inside to pray. In a fit of religious fervor he beheads himself to free Sita to marry Nanda. Nanda then enters the temple, and when he finds Shridaman's corpse, he realizes the motive for his friend's suicide. Overcome with remorse, Nanda likewise beheads himself.
Sita enters the temple and on discovering what has happened is about to hang herself. Kali appears. She tells Sita to place the heads back on the bodies and she will bring them both back to life. However, in her grief and agitation Sita places Nanda's head on Shridaman's body and vice versa. After Kali works her magic, each man now finds himself with his original head and identity but a new body.

At first the men profess to be happy with the new arrangement. Nevertheless, they decide to consult the guru Kamadamana as to which of the two men is actually her husband. Kamadamana determines that it is the one with the head of Shridaman. In his disappointment, Nanda becomes a religious recluse.

Several years have passed. Sita is pining for Nanda and seeks him out in his hermitage. Shridaman follows her there and confronts them. He proposes the only solution for a situation where a woman is simultaneously in love with one man's body and another man's head. They must ""merge their separate essences in the universal whole."" The two men commit suicide by simultaneously stabbing each other in the heart. Sita throws herself on the men's joint funeral pyre.

Instead, the performance was reworked as a film, shot on location at the Victorian music hall. The whole space of the venue, not just the stage, was used to tell the story.
A singer known as Prologue tells about a young  (who remains unnamed throughout the opera) he once knew who cared for two children at Bly House. She had been hired by their uncle and guardian, who lived in London and was too busy to care for them. After hiring her, he laid three stipulations on the Governess: Never to write to him about the children, never to inquire about the history of Bly House, and never to abandon the children.
The Governess is apprehensive about her new position. When she arrives at Bly House, the housekeeper, Mrs. Grose, and the children greet her. When the Governess sees Miles, the little boy, their eyes lock and the Governess feels as if she has a strange connection with Miles. Mrs. Grose interrupts their reverie and leads the Governess off to explore the beautiful land around the house. The Governess sings that all her fears are now gone. A letter from Miles' school arrives, advising the Governess that the boy has been  but giving no reason. The Governess is sure that Miles, like his sister Flora, is too innocent to have done anything bad enough for expulsion. Encouraged by Mrs. Grose, she decides to ignore the letter.
The Governess sings about her wonderful position at the house and the beautiful children she has in her care. But she is troubled by footsteps she has heard outside her door and cries in the night. Suddenly, she spots a pale-faced man perched on a tower of the house. When the man disappears, she becomes frightened and wonders if she has seen a ghost. Her mind is put at ease by the playing of the children, and their singing of the  """". Later she sees the same man looking in through a window. She decides to ask Mrs. Grose about the man. Based on her description the housekeeper tells the Governess about Peter Quint, the former valet at Bly House. Mrs. Grose implies that Quint may have been a  who preyed on Miles, and that he had a sexual relationship with Miss Jessel, the young and beautiful previous governess. Mrs. Grose hints that Miss Jessel, too, had a relationship to the children that seemed inappropriately close. The housekeeper did nothing, since Quint intimidated her, and she explains ""it wasn't my place"". Miss Jessel left the house and eventually died. Shortly thereafter, Quint died under mysterious circumstances on an icy road near Bly House. The Governess rededicates herself to protecting the children. The next morning, the Governess is teaching Miles , when he suddenly enters into a trance-like state and sings a song, ""Malo"".
Later that day, the Governess sits by the side of a lake with Flora. Flora recites the names of the seas of the world, finishing with the . Flora's comparison of the Dead Sea with Bly House unsettles the Governess. As Flora plays on the shore with her doll, the Governess suddenly sees a strange woman across the lake who seems to be watching Flora. The horrified Governess realises that the woman is a ghost — the ghost of Miss Jessel, who has returned to claim Flora. The Governess hurries Flora home to safety.
That night, Miles and Flora slip out into the woods to meet Miss Jessel and Peter Quint. The children fantasize about a world where dreams come true. The Governess and Mrs. Grose arrive as the children are about to be , and the spirits depart. Miles sings a haunting song about how he has been a bad boy.
The ghosts of Peter Quint and Miss Jessel reappear. They argue about who harmed whom first when they were alive, and accuse one another of not acting quickly enough to possess the children. In her room, the Governess worries about the evil she feels in the house.
The next morning, the family goes to church. The children sing a song which sounds similar to a psalm. Mrs. Grose declares that nothing can be wrong if the children are as sweet as this. The Governess tells her of Miles' unearthly day-dream song and Flora's bizarre behaviour. Alarmed, Mrs. Grose advises the Governess to write to their employer in London. At first, the Governess declines, recalling her employer's admonitions before she took the job. But when Miles mentions the ghosts of Quint and Jessel, the Governess realises things are much more dire than they seem. She resolves to leave Bly House.
After church, the family returns home. The Governess goes into the children's schoolroom where she sees the ghost of Miss Jessel seated at the teacher's desk. The spectre bemoans her fate, and sings about how she suffers in the afterlife. The Governess confronts the spirit, which vanishes. Believing the ghosts may not yet have the upper hand, the Governess changes her mind, deciding to stay at Bly House after all. Instead, she writes to the children's uncle, informing him that she must speak with him.
That night, the Governess tells Miles that she has written to his uncle about the spirits haunting Bly House. She departs. The voice of Quint calls out to Miles, terrifying him. The lights go out, and the ghost hovers over the terrified child. Quint tells Miles to steal the letter. The boy goes to the schoolroom, finds the letter, and takes it back to his room.
The next morning, Miles plays the piano for the Governess and Mrs. Grose. While the Governess is distracted by his performance, Flora slips off to go to the lake. When the two women realise Flora is gone, they search for her. Finding the girl at the lake, the Governess sees the spectre of Miss Jessel nearby—but Mrs. Grose sees nothing. The Governess tries to force Flora to admit that the apparition is there, but Flora denies seeing anything and hurls  at the Governess. Mrs. Grose, convinced the Governess has gone too far, angrily takes Flora home. The Governess feels betrayed by Mrs. Grose.
That night, Flora begins to rant and rave about committing unspeakable horrors. Mrs. Grose agrees to take Flora away from the house. The housekeeper tells the Governess that the letter was never mailed and that Miles must have taken it. The Governess confronts Miles alone. As she questions him, the ghost of Quint pressures Miles not to betray him. Hysterical, Miles confesses that he took the letter. The Governess demands to know who put Miles up to it. Miles blurts out Quint's name. At the mention of his name, Quint's ghost vanishes and Miles falls dead on the floor. A weeping Governess cradles the dead child in her arms, singing aloud of her grief and wondering if she did the right thing after all.

Troilus and Cressida,William Walton,3 December 1954,Royal Opera House,English,1954,Christopher Hassall," is the first of the two  by , and was premiered in 1954. The  was by , his own first opera libretto, based on 's poem . Walton dedicated the score to his wife, .
The genesis of the opera dated back to the mid-1940s, after the success of 's first great operatic success, . Walton intended to counter this work with an opera of his own, and Alice Wimborne, Walton's companion at the time, suggested the story of  as a subject. Wimborne had suggested Hassell as librettist, in spite of the fact that he had never written an opera libretto. During the course of composition, Walton and Hassell carried out an extensive correspondence. Walton edited passages by Hassell from the libretto that he deemed inappropriate, or in his own coined term, ""Novelloismo"". The opera took seven years to complete.
The opera was first produced at the , London, on 3 December 1954 conducted by , and directed by . It was only a moderate success, and various factors were proposed to assess blame for the lacklustre performance, including the conductor not having thoroughly learned the score in advance.
The US première took place on 7 October 1955 at , conducted by , with Walton in attendance. The cast included  as Troilus,  as Cressida,  as Calkas, Carl Palangi as Antenor,  as Pandarus, and  as Evadne. The New York premiere was presented by  on 21 October 1955.   staged the work in January 1956. Covent Garden revived the piece in 1963, with Sargent again conducting.
The Australian premiere was in March 1964, a highlight of the , with Richard Lewis and  and the  under .
Contemporary criticism of the libretto from , just after the premiere, spoke highly of the libretto's construction, but also noted that the plot began slowly and could have used dramatic tightening in Act I. Other criticisms of the opera have spoken of a lack of sufficient dramatic tension and also Walton resorting to repeated use of past stylistic mannerisms. In his contemporary review of the work, Donald Mitchell noted the overall competence and craft of the opera, and at the same time its overall indebtedness to the style of , summarizing briefly: ""Walton only achieves his success at the expense of his individuality.""
Defenders of the opera have noted that at the time of the premiere, the mid-1950s, music in a more conventionally tonal idiom, such as Walton's, was frowned upon during an era when serialism was more dominant in modern music. Walton himself later commented on the problematic fate of the opera as follows, as quoted in a 2002 retrospective article: ""I was trying to write a romantic opera, . I felt that opera should have tunes to sing. Unfortunately, I don't seem to have ever found the voices that I dreamt I would.""
In 1976, Walton prepared an edition of the opera for  to sing in a Covent Garden production; parts of the score were transposed down to accommodate the lower  of Baker's voice as compared to that of , for whom the role was conceived. Walton also made cuts to the score. A commercial recording was released based on these live Covent Garden performances. For a 1995 production at , a new edition was commissioned, edited by Stuart Hutchinson, which restored the soprano register and restored the music cut by Walton in 1976. For its 2008 production,  commissioned a new performing edition with both the original soprano register and a reduced orchestration.
Calkas announces to the people that the oracle at Delphi has conveyed signs that Greece will prevail in the conflict.  The Trojan people refuse to accept this interpretation of the oracle and are suspicious of Calkas.  Antenor demands proof, but Troilus defends Calkas from the crowd.  Cressida, a priestess in the temple of Pallas Athene and daughter of Calkas, then receives declarations of love from Troilus, whom she has noticed prior, but she retreats into the temple.  Pandarus, uncle to Cressida, has overheard this conversation and offers his services to further Troilus's romantic cause.  Evadne then brings the news that Calkas has defected to the Greek side.  Pandarus then finds Cressida in tears, and tells her that the protection of a prince might be helpful to her.  Troilus comes in with the news that Antenor has been captured, and that he must be retrieved by any means necessary.  They look for Calkas to ask his blessing for such an enterprise, but Calkas is absent, and they go in search of him.  Pandarus then pleads Troilus's case with Cressida, and she becomes sympathetic.  She gives Pandarus her red scarf to give to Troilus as a pledge of her affection, and he invites her to his residence the next evening.  Troilus returns to the temple, aware of Calkas's betrayal, and receives an initial sign of Cressida's approval.

Cressida and Horaste are at a game of chess.  As all are about to go home, a storm is on the horizon.  Pandarus persuades Cressida and her company, including Evadne, to stay the night.  He then secretly sends a messenger to bring Troilus to his house.  As Cressida is about to retire, Troilus enters the house.  He reaffirms his love for her, and she reciprocates.  They leave to a side chamber, and their love scene is depicted in the orchestra.

Troilus and Cressida are about to part.  Pandarus then enters to tell the news that Greek soldiers are on his grounds, and that Troilus must hide.  There is to be a prisoner exchange, with Cressida going to the Greeks and Antenor to be returned to the Trojans.  Diomede enters and demands to see Cressida.  Pandarus denies her presence, but Diomede discovers her behind a curtain.  Her beauty immediately strikes him, and he orders her to prepare for the journey.  After all parties have left, Troilus emerges from hiding, and the two lovers acknowledge fate.  Troilus promises that he will bribe the sentries to be able to meet her, and that she should look for him at one end of the Greek camp.  He returns the red scarf, the token of their love.

Cressida has still not heard anything from Troilus.  Cressida asks Evadne to await a messenger, but Evadne has been secretly destroying Troilus's messages on orders from Calkas.  Evadne urges Cressida to accept Diomede as suitor, but Cressida strongly refuses.  Calkas further rebukes Cressida for continuing to refuse Diomede.  Diomede appears, and at his final proposal after Cressida has still not heard anything from Troilus, she yields to Diomede's entreaties.  Diomede asks of her the red scarf as a token of her pledge.
Troilus and Pandarus then appear with the news that they have arranged for a ransom for Cressida, during a truce in the hostilities.  Cressida says that they are too late, and the Greeks then appear to hail Cressida, betrothed to Diomede.  Diomede bears the red scarf, which Troilus recognizes.  Troilus claims Cressida as his.  Diomede asks Cressida to denounce Troilus, but she cannot.  Troilus then challenges Diomede, and they engage in single combat.  As Troilus is about to overpower Diomede, Calkas stabs Troilus in the back.  Troilus dies in Cressida's arms.  Diomede orders Troilus to be borne back to Troy in honour, Calkas to be returned to Troy in chains, and Cressida to remain with the Greeks as an unprivileged prisoner.  Left alone, Cressida finds Troilus's sword and conceals it.  As the Greeks come to take her away, she pledges her loyalty one last time to Troilus, and stabs herself.

The Tender Land,Aaron Copland,"April 1, 1954",New York City Opera,English,1954,Horace Everett," is an  with music by  and libretto by Horace Everett, a pseudonym for .  
The opera tells of a farm family in the  of the United States.  Copland was inspired to write this opera after viewing the Depression-era photographs of  and reading 's .  He wrote the work between 1952 and 1954 for the , with the intention of its being presented on television.  However, the television producers rejected the opera.
Eventually, the work had its premiere on April 1, 1954 at the , with  as the conductor,  as the director, and a cast including the young . It was poorly received, with criticism focused on the weaknesses of the opera's characters and the storyline.  Later analysis by Christopher Patton stated that one underlying cause of the opera's failure at the premiere was the contrast between writing for the intimate medium of television, the originally intended medium of the work, versus the more public and larger-scale setting of an opera house.
Patton has also commented on the role of Erik Johns' interest in the  branch of  in the libretto.
Copland and Johns made revisions to the opera, expanding Act 2 for performances at Tanglewood in August 1954, and making further adjustments for Oberlin College in 1955.  With the composer's agreement, Murry Sidlin re-scored the work with reduced forces - the same scoring as the original 13 instrument version of  - for a production in New Haven in 1987, a staging that ran for more than 50 performances. Sidlin also added two of Copland's  to the central party scene.
On July 28, 1965, the composer conducted a concert version of his work, as part of the French-American Festival, with the .  In the cast were , , , , and .  Three days later,  recorded an abridged version of the opera, again conducted by Copland, at the , with the same cast.  In 2000,  released the historic performance on compact disc.
The setting is the 1930s in the midwestern United States, at the time of the spring harvest and also of high school graduation.
Laurie, the high-school senior daughter of the Moss family, is on the brink of graduating from high school.  At the start of the opera, Beth, Laurie's sister, is dancing by herself, and Ma Moss, Laurie and Beth's mother, is sewing.  The postman, Mr. Splinters, delivers a package with Laurie's graduation dress.  He also brings gossip about a neighbor's daughter being frightened by two strangers to the area.  Ma Moss and Grandpa Moss are worried about this.  Two itinerant workers, Top and Martin, arrive on the scene.  After initial suspicion, Grandpa Moss agrees to hire Top and Martin to help out with the harvest.  Laurie and Martin meet, and feel sympathy for each other.  Top asks for Martin's help later in getting Grandpa Moss drunk at the party that night.
The party to celebrate Laurie's graduation is going on.  Everyone has eaten well, and Laurie acknowledges the guests' well wishes to her.  The dance begins.  Ma Moss thinks that Top and Martin are the two strangers reported to be causing trouble in the area, and tells Mr. Splinters, who goes to tell the local sheriff.  As the dance proceeds, Grandpa Moss becomes more drunk.  Laurie and Martin are now in love, and they kiss at one moment.  Grandpa Moss sees this and becomes angry.  Top tells Martin that they should leave, but the sheriff arrives with the news that the two strangers causing the local disturbances have been caught.  Even though Top and Martin have been proven innocent, Grandpa Moss says that they have to leave in the morning.
Later that night, Laurie and Martin dream of eloping.  However, Martin changes his mind, with the counsel of Top in the background advising that such a situation would cause great trouble for them all.  During the night, while Laurie is packing, Top and Martin secretly leave.  Laurie is left alone, but then suddenly resolves to leave home and make her own way in the world.  Ma Moss and Beth try to change Laurie's mind, but she is determined to move on.  Ma Moss accepts this eventually.  The opera ends as Laurie leaves, with Beth dancing by herself as she did at the beginning, now the sole hope for future generations of the family and for the farm.
""The Promise of Living"" is best known, often performed as a separate choral anthem.
An orchestral suite based on the opera was compiled by Copland in 1958.  In 1996, Murry Sidlin created a new suite, which, like his version of the opera, uses reduced scoring (for soprano, tenor and chamber ensemble).
Copland reused the revivalist song ""Zion's Walls"" from his second set of  in .
The first UK production in just under twenty years was staged at  in August 2009, directed by , conducted by Leigh Thompson and produced by Racky Plews for MadCow Theatre Company.
 produced the opera at Cahn Auditorium in  on May 18, 19, 20 and 21, 2017.  The program credited Boosey & Hawkes.  The program stated that Copland had been in residence at Northwestern from February 17 to March 2, 1958 giving ""lectures on music and composing"".  There had been a production conducted by Copland with the Northwestern University Music School on February 28, 1958, also at Cahn Auditorium.

In her tenement on Bleecker Street, Annina has visions of Jesus Christ and wakes up to find stigmata on her hands (""Oh sweet Jesus, spare me the agony""). The neighbors and Don Marco, the neighborhood priest, believe that she is a saint with healing powers, but her protective brother Michele makes them leave and declares that her visions are simply the evidence of illness. Annina discovers to her dismay that her friend Carmela is going to be married instead of becoming a nun with Annina.

Ah Michele, don't you know""). Michele refuses because he doesn't want to leave his ill sister. When he tries to sneak Desideria into the reception, it starts a fight with other guests. Michele accuses the guests of throwing away their Italian heritage (""Although you made this land your home""). Michele and Annina decide to go home, but Desideria flies into a jealous rage and accuses him of being in love with his sister. Michele, enraged, stabs Desideria in the back and flees.

When Michele refuses, Annina reveals that she is dying and intends to take the veil before she succumbs to illness. As her health deteriorates dangerously, Don Marco finally receives approval from the church to make Annina a nun. While Annina is taking her vows, Michele forces his way past watching neighbors and tries to convince her to give up her plans. However, Annina is too far gone to hear him and dies shortly after completing the ceremony.

The Fiery Angel,Sergei Prokofiev,25 November 1955,"Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, Paris",Russian,1954,Prokofiev,"'s opera,  (Russian: ,  ), Op. 37, could be considered one of the composer’s largest challenges.  Writing, production, and location were all factors in the piece’s progress.  Prokofiev had completed the orchestration in 1927, but the journey to completion was not truly over until after Prokofiev’s time, when the piece was first presented in a full performance at the  on 25 November 1954, and was first premiered at the Venice Festival in 1955.
Prokofiev's  was based on a  of the same name by .  Prokofiev was more intrigued by the “orgies” (here, indulgence of passion) presented in the novel rather than the story ideas.   The novel was inspired by Bryusov’s own experiences with one Nina Petrovskaya, and was considered one of the beginnings of the Russian Symbolist movement known as , or “The Scales.”  Nina was the mistress of .  In their time together, Nina also came to know Bryusov in 1904, and this started to cause obvious concerns for Bely.  There was an anticipated brawl on a remote road in Moscow, but a mutual friend of Bryusov and Bely prevented the fight.  Nina, Andrey, and Bryusov inspired Prokofiev’s characters in his opera, making the novel the prime source of inspiration for the work.  The novel was also the basis for the libretto of Prokofiev’s opera, which the composer himself wrote with the help of Demchinsky.
Originally the opera was in three acts and eleven scenes, but was eventually reorganized into five acts and seven scenes.
Renata, a young woman searching for a missing love, resides at an inn.  Ruprecht, a knight errant, meets Renata at the inn.  She tells him that, since her childhood, she has been in love with an angel.  This angel, Madiel, encouraged her to do good deeds, and at the age of seventeen she finally asked for his physical love.  The angel, in response, glowed in fury, but agreed to return in human form.  After Madiel’s promise, Renata had met Count Heinrich von Otterheim.  Convinced that this was her angel returned to Earth, Renata immediately gave herself to him.  One year later, Otterheim left.  In denial, Renata begs Ruprecht to help her search for Otterheim.
As the two search for Otterheim, Ruprecht soon falls in love with Renata, although she does not share the feeling.  They decide to resort to sorcery to find Otterheim, and a spell is cast. Three knocks are then heard at the door.  Renata assumes the spell has worked and nearly goes insane at the thought of Otterheim returning.  But nobody is there.  Ruprecht and Renata seek out the powerful sorcerer . Once in his lair, they are met with his refusal to help; his concerns lie with the power of the Inquisition.
Ruprecht learns that Renata has finally found Count Heinrich von Otterheim, who has rejected her.  She begs to be avenged, learning that he was never her angel.  Ruprecht attempts to exact revenge for Renata by dueling with Otterheim.  The duel is one-sided, as Otterheim easily overcomes Ruprecht and injures him.
Ruprecht and Renata have moved in together, but Renata now insists on joining a convent to better herself and for her soul’s sake. There is a comic relief, involving Faust and Mephistopheles at a tavern. (This tavern scene, used to break up the dark sarcastic nature of the opera, is sometimes left out.)
Renata is in the convent, where the leaders accuse her of demonic possession.  As an attempt to heal Renata ensues, all Hell essentially breaks loose (both on stage and in the orchestra) as the other nuns are also possessed.  She is condemned by the Inquisitor to be burned at the stake.
With no previous commissions or any actual production being present, Prokofiev set out to write  at one of the only times of his life in which religion was considered for his works.  The thematic style is more like Prokofiev’s pre-Revolution operas (such as The Gambler), even with the ambiguity.  The only theme that strays from the ambiguous is the theme involved with the evil forces.   
The opera as a whole is a contrast to some of Prokofiev’s earlier operas (such as his opera ) just by being a tragedy, and the story was considered very appropriate for Prokofiev’s dark and sarcastic style. 
The production of the opera was one of the biggest hurdles, for different reasons, Prokofiev faced.  There was a large amount of extra material in the work, there were what was considered violations of theater, negotiations with different theaters both in Europe and America continued to fail.  In the midst of it all, Prokofiev felt like he was unappreciated and unwanted, but his pride kept him striving for recognition.  
In 1926, Bruno Walter made Prokofiev an offer to have  produced at a Berlin theater, which prompted the composer to work on the orchestration.  The orchestration was finished in 1927.  The production was still unsuccessful.   The opera and inspiration came and went, but it was the promises of production that kept Prokofiev writing. 
Prokofiev, who had been working on the opera for years, was reluctant to let the music languish unperformed, and after hearing a concert performance of its second act given by Serge Koussevitzky in June 1928, he adapted parts of the opera to make his  in C minor, Op. 44, later that year.
	 was met with mixed reviews for different reasons.  Largely,  was, despite lack of productions, reviewed as Prokofiev’s “… strongest and most dramatically intense scores.”   In a review of the Bolshoi performance of , it is said that Prokofiev’s “…score is crazy, but shouldn’t sound chaotic.” Prokofiev may have only been interested in the overarching story rather than the smaller details.  It was also criticized that maybe the language would have been better in French rather than Russian.    Some even called the opera a “16th-century Carmen with supernatural trimmings” amongst other mixed reviews.  Another criticism is that  is nothing but confusion and noise with the “modern” title.   Using staging should not be there to make up for the music, but to mix with it and make a grand production.   Prokofiev was able to write the music how he saw fit, which appealed to many more than the staging has, according to different reviews.

The opera depicts the relationship between Queen Elizabeth and the , and was composed for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in June 1953. Several in the audience of its gala opening were disappointed by the opera, which presents the first Elizabeth as a sympathetic, but flawed, character motivated largely by vanity and desire.

She requests that they attend her at court as friends. Mountjoy and Essex make peace and the crowd praise Elizabeth.

Elizabeth and Cecil discuss the rivalry between Mountjoy and Essex. Cecil warns Elizabeth about the threat of another Armada from Spain and cautions her that it would be dangerous to show too much affection to the impulsive Essex. After Cecil has gone, Essex himself enters and sings to the Queen to take her mind off political problems. He asks her to let him go to Ireland to counter the rebellion led by the . He grows impatient when the Queen shows reluctance, and accuses Cecil and Walter Raleigh of plotting against him. Elizabeth sends him away and prays for strength to rule her people well.

Lady Essex enters, wearing a plainer dress than before and tells Lady Rich that her original dress has gone missing.

However, she becomes angry when the proud Lady Rich implies that the Queen needs Essex to rule effectively. Elizabeth refuses to listen to further entreaties and signs Essex's death warrant. Alone again, she reflects on her relationship with Essex and her own mortality.

The work's first performance was at , on 27 January 1955, conducted by . The reception of the opera was controversial, over confusion as to the libretto and Tippett's use of symbols and psychological references. The opera has received at least 10 more productions, in England, Wales, Scotland, Germany, Sweden and the United States, including two more at the Royal Opera House.
The premiere performance was recorded, and has been issued on compact disc. Covent Garden revived the work in 1968, conducted by , with the Ritual Dances choreographed by  and in 1970, when the production formed the basis of the first commercial recording. Tippett extracted the  from the opera as a separate concert work.
The story of  was consciously modeled after 's . Both trace the path to marriage of one ""royal"" and one ""common"" couple: Jenifer and Mark correspond to Pamina and Tamino, the earthy Jack and Bella to Papageno and Papagena. King Fisher stands in for the Queen of the Night, the Ancients for Sarastro and his priests, and so on.
But the composer's first inspiration for the work was visual: Tippett recalled imagining ""a wooded hill-top with a temple, where a warm and soft young man was being rebuffed by a cold and hard young woman to such a degree that the collective, magical archetypes take charge – 's .""
The character Sosostris is named after ""Madame Sosostris, the famous clairvoyante,"" in 's poem """", and King Fisher's name is inspired by the  character mentioned in the same poem. Tippett was first given the idea of attempting a verse drama by reading Eliot's plays, and he corresponded with Eliot with a view to collaboration, tackling the libretto himself when Eliot declined.
The Royal Opera House has mounted three productions of , in 1955, 1968 and 1996. The 1996 production was revived in 2005, to mark the centenary of Tippett's birth.  effected the costumes and stage designs for the lavish original (1955) production. Choreography was by .

Other British productions have been staged by  and , both in 1985, and  in 1988.
A production was filmed for television in 1984,  later released on , with  conducting the  and  and  in the lead roles.
Abroad, the opera has received at least five productions. The German premiere was on 29 September 1973, at the  with Lieselotte Rebmann as Jennifer. Another German production was at the  in 1998. Other productions have been at Stockholm in 1982, San Francisco in 1983,  in 1993 and the  in 2005.

The opera is set in a forest clearing, with a group of buildings to one side. The buildings resemble a sanctuary, with a Greek temple in the middle. A set of spiral stairs leads off to the right and breaks off in midair. To the left, they lead down into the hillside. The costumes are contemporary, aside from the dancers and the Ancients.
A group of young people enters the clearing, surprised by the strange buildings. They hide as Strephon leads the dancers and the Ancients out of the temple. Mark emerges and asks for a new dance in honor of his wedding day. The Ancients warn him of the dangers of thwarting tradition. To demonstrate the point, the He-Ancient trips Strephon as he dances. His bride Jenifer arrives, but she is distant, having run away from her father, King Fisher. She ascends the stone staircase and disappears.
King Fisher arrives, and Mark enters the cavern. King Fisher thinks Jenifer is with Mark, and he summons Jack to break down the gates after the Ancients refuse to let him inside. During the argument, a radiant Jenifer reappears. Mark returns as well, glowing blood red. Representing ""starry heaven"" and ""fruitful earth"", the two confront each other. Jenifer says her soul is free of earthly suffering, while Mark claims to have gained new appreciation for the miracle of mortality. Jenifer tries to show Mark his error in a mirror, but Mark causes the mirror to fall and shatter. The couple reverse their paths, and Jenifer descends into the hillside while Mark ascends the stairs and disappears.
In the clearing, Jack and Bella meet and decide to marry. They walk into the woods, and Strephon emerges with his dancers to perform three rituals. In the first, a hound chases a hare, but the hare escapes. In the second, an otter chases a fish, who hurts himself on the root of a tree. In the third, a bird with a broken wing is captured by a hawk. Bella is terrified by the rituals. Jack comforts her as she recomposes herself. Reassured, they resume their playful interlude and run off into the woods.
King Fisher orders the group of young people to fetch Madame Sosostris, his clairvoyant. He is determined to thwart the Ancients, convinced that they are responsible for Jenifer's disappearance. The group returns with Sosostris, and King Fisher orders her to reveal Jenifer's location. She warns him against such inquiries into the dream world, but she reveals Jenifer to be lying in a meadow consorting with a winged lion who has the arms and face of a man. Enraged, King Fisher insists Sosostris is lying to him, and he attempts to unveil her.
As he peels away her veils, they begin to glow. When he has stripped all the veils away, he finds an incandescent bud, which blossoms to reveal Mark and Jenifer. King Fisher aims his pistol at Mark, but the couple break from their meditative state to confront King Fisher, causing his heart to fail. The crowd carries his body into the temple. Strephon emerges from the temple with his dancers to perform a fourth ritual, which celebrates carnal love by transforming it into the fire of divine love. The ritual concludes as the bud closes around Mark and Jenifer and bursts into flames.
When the fire subsides, Mark, Jenifer and the Ancients are gone. As the moonlight fades, Mark and Jenifer enter the clearing from opposite sides, dressed for their wedding. They head off down the hill with the crowd as the sun rises. The dawn reveals that the buildings were never more than ruins.

He Who Gets Slapped,Robert Ward,"May 17, 1956","Lincoln Center, New York City",,1956,Bernard Stambler," (also known as  and ) is a 1956  in 3 Acts by composer  with an English language  by Bernard Stambler which is based on 's . The first of Ward's nine operas, the opera is written in a lyrical style reminiscent of . The work is infrequently performed; with its most notable staging being at  by the  in 1959. Stambler's adaptation of the play made some notable changes in plot and characterization, condensing the final two acts of the four act play into one act. The play's central character, ""He"", was renamed  in reference to the character from Italian . Additionally, the play's tragic murder and suicides at the end are removed for a somewhat happier conclusion where Pantaloon is rejected by Consuelo instead of Pantaloon murdering her.
Robert Ward first got the idea of adapting  into an opera after reading the first two acts of psychoanalyst 's English translation of the play in 1948. He approached his fellow Juilliard School faculty member, Bernard Stambler, to write the libretto. Upon reading the last two acts, both men were dissatisfied with the progression of the play, and the decision was made to substantially alter the focus of the plot for the second half of the work. The character of the ""Gentleman"" was entirely removed, and the story's focus shifted to Mancini's efforts to marry off Consuelo to the Baron. Rather than have a tragic murder-suicide by poison at the end, the writers chose instead to have Consuelo reject Pantaloon's profession of love and go off with her lover Begano instead.
At the suggestion of arts patron Elizabeth Kray Ussachevsky, the clown roles of Polly and Tilly were turned from dialogue roles to silent roles skilled in  in order to avoid the difficulty of finding opera singers who were able to do acrobatics and other clown tricks as well as sing. Opera directors and conductors Frederic Cohen and Frederick Waldmann of the Juilliard Opera Theater helped in the development process of the opera, by having graduate students in the opera program at Juilliard sing through material as it was being written. Ward and Stan and Stambler modified their work upon feedback from Cohen, Waldmann, and the students involved. Other artists who gave valuable input included , , , and .
Setting: A circus in a large city in France
In the first act of the opera, a mysterious man, later known as Pantaloon, arrives at Briquet's circus. He requests to join the troop as a clown. Briquet asks to see Pantaloon's identification in order to register his employment with the government. Pantaloon discloses his name into Briquet's ear, without revealing it to the audience. The reaction of the circus owner reveals that Pantaloon is a famous upper class intellectual who is highly respected, but the audience gains no further knowledge of the character other than he is 39 years old.
In the second act, Pantaloon is now an established clown in Briquet's circus and his act is highly successful, making him popular with the troop and their audiences. He has fallen in love with Consuelo from afar, who is herself in love with Begano. Consuelo's father, Baron Regnard, attempts to get Count Mancini to marry her. Pantaloon argues with Baron Regnard, claiming that the Count will never marry her. The Baron and Consuelo become engaged after she is pressured by her father. At the end of the act Zinida reveal's Pantaloon's past as a man broken by an adulterous wife who publicly humiliated him in upper class society.
In the third act, Pantaloon plays the part of an intoxicated court jester. He successfully sabotages Mancini's plans to marry Consuelo. He professes his love to her. She rejects him, and goes off with Begano instead.
In the Fall of 1955 the director of 'a Columbia Theatre Associates and Opera Workshop (CTAOW), Milton Smith and the director of Columbia's opera program, , agreed to stage the opera using funds provided by the .

Rinaldo had loved Folco's wife Giselda, and had longed to marry her.  Giselda questions Folco as to why he has summoned her old love, whom she has not seen since their wedding.  Folco tells her that Rinaldo is bringing with him a magician, whom Folco hopes will be able to tell him the meaning of a disturbing encounter he'd experienced while hunting earlier that day.
Rinaldo finally appears, accompanied by the mysterious necromancer Salomone.  Folco welcomes them warmly, and in his aria ""Allora ascolta!"", explains how, while pursuing a wolf in the snowy forest, he'd raised his eyes to behold a white hind whose face was that of Giselda.  Bewildered, he had stabbed the creature, whose sad eyes seemed to beg for mercy, and then had fled, horrified, into the forest.  Salomone explains that if Folco's love for Giselda can survive, he must return to the forest, find the wounded hind, and carry it lovingly back to the castle, as if it were Giselda herself.  Folco assures the magician that he can certainly accomplish this.
As soon as Folco leaves, Rinaldo passionately informs Giselda that he has never forgotten his love for her, but rather has, in the loneliness of his dwelling gazed upon her, and held her as if she were all his.  Giselda scolds Rinaldo, but he assures her that love can accomplish anything, and that he thus has no doubt that she will be his.  But Giselda scoffs at his ardent assurances.  Love can do anything?  Can it change the wintry garden that they see through the window to spring?  If love can do that, she tells him, then she'll believe him.  But Salomone interjects, ""If you love, you shall see the spring.""
Folco now returns.  He has not found the body of the doe in the forest, and mysteriously, cannot seem to see Giselda now either, but rather sees the body of the doe lying where she stands.  
Suddenly, the garden blossoms, and Giselda sings ecstatically of its ravishing beauty, and yields herself to Rinaldo's love.
Private recordings of the original 1943 radio broadcast have circulated for years.  This performance was released in 1999 as part of the album  on the  label.  It features  as Folco,  as Giselda,  as Rinaldo, and  as Salomone.

Candide,,,,,1956,," is an  with music composed by , based on the 1759   by . The operetta was first performed in 1956 with a  by ; but since 1974 it has been generally performed with a book by  which is more faithful to Voltaire's novel. The primary lyricist was the poet . Other contributors to the text were , , , , , , and Bernstein himself.  and  contributed orchestrations. Although unsuccessful at its premiere,  has now overcome the unenthusiastic reaction of early audiences and critics and achieved more popularity.
 was originally conceived by  as a play with incidental music in the style of her previous work, . Bernstein, however, was so excited about this idea that he convinced Hellman to do it as a ""comic operetta""; she then wrote the original libretto for the operetta. Many lyricists worked on the show: first  (whose work was ultimately not used), then ,  and . In addition, the lyrics to ""I Am Easily Assimilated"" were done by Leonard and , and Hellman wrote the words to ""Eldorado"".  orchestrated all but the , which Bernstein did himself.
 first opened on  as a  on December 1, 1956, at the . The premiere production was directed by  and conducted by . The sets and costumes were designed by  and , respectively. It was choreographed by . It featured  as Candide,  as Cunegonde,  as Dr. Pangloss, and  as the Old Lady. This production was a box office disaster, running only two months for a total of 73 performances. Hellman's libretto was criticized in  as being too serious:
The first London production debuted at the  on  on 30 April 1959 (after playing for a short time at the  and the ). This production used Lillian Hellman's book with an additional credit 'assisted by Michael Stewart', and it was directed by  with choreography by . The cast included  as Candide,  as Cunegonde,  as Dr. Pangloss and  as the Old Lady. The musical director was Alexander Faris.
Without Bernstein's involvement, the show underwent a series of Broadway revivals under the direction of . , the author of the original book, refused to let any of her work be used in the revival, so Prince commissioned a new, one-act book from . The sole element of Hellman's book that remained was her invented name (Maximilian) for Cunegonde's brother. (The character has no given name in Voltaire's novella, and is referred to as ""Cundegonde's brother"" or ""the young Baron"".)
The lyrics were worked on by the team of artists listed above. This 105-minute version, omitting over half of the musical numbers, was known as the ""Chelsea version"", and opened in 1973 at 's  in the , before moving to the  in 1974 and running there for nearly two years, closing in 1976 after 740 performances. The 1974 Broadway revival starred  (Candide), Maureen Brennan (Cunegonde),  (Maximilian),  (Dr. Pangloss), and  as the Old Lady.
The Chelsea version was marked by a unique production style.  helped Prince make sure that the multi-scene show would not get bogged down in set changes – he created platforms for the action that allowed scenes to change by refocusing attention instead of changing scenery. Actors performed on platforms in front, behind, and sometimes between audience members. Some sat on bleachers, others on stools on the stage floor. As the story unfolded, so did the stage, with sections falling from above, opening, closing, flying apart or coming together. A 13-member orchestra played from four areas. The conductor, who wore period costume and gold braid, could be seen by audience and musicians alike on television monitors.
In response to requests from opera companies for a more legitimate version, the show was expanded on the basis of Wheeler's book. The two-act ""opera house version"" contains most of Bernstein's music, including some songs that were not orchestrated for the original production. It was first performed by the  (NYCO) in 1982 under Prince's direction, and ran for thirty-four performances with a cast that included David Eisler as Candide, Erie Mills as Cunegonde, Deborah Darr as Paquette,  in the quintuple roles of Voltaire/Pangloss/Businessman/Governor/Gambler,  as the Old Lady, Scott Reeve as Maximillian,  as the Huntsman and Bulgarian Soldier, and  as the Judge/Father Bernard/Don Issachar/First Gambler/Maximillian's Servant. The cast filmed  the production for national broadcast on 's  in 1982. The NYCO later recorded this version of  in 1985 with the same cast with the exception of the roles of Paquette (now performed by Maris Clement) and the Old Lady (now performed by ). This recording was awarded the  in 1987. Opera companies around the world have performed this version, and the production has remained a staple of NYCO's repertoire with the most recent performance being given in 2019.
The Australian premiere in 1982 by the  and directed by  at Sydney's  featured  in the title role.
In 1988, by which point Hellman had died, Bernstein started working alongside , then director of , to produce a version that expressed his final wishes regarding . Wheeler died before he could work again on the text, and  was engaged.  The new show was first produced by  with the credit ""Adapted for Scottish Opera by John Wells and John Mauceri"".  After Bernstein had attended the final rehearsals and the opening in Glasgow, he decided that the time had come for the composer himself to re-examine . Taking the Scottish Opera version as a basis, he made changes in orchestration, shuffled the order of numbers in the second act, and altered the endings of several numbers.  Bernstein then conducted and recorded what he called his ""final revised version"" with  as Candide,  as Cunegonde,  as the Old Lady,  as Maximilian and  as Dr. Pangloss/Martin.  Deutsche Grammophon released a DVD (2006, 147 min.), in 5.0 , of the 13 December 1989 recording at the London , with a bonus video prologue and epilogue from the composer and a printed insert ""Bernstein and Voltaire"" by narrative collaborator  explaining what Bernstein wanted in this final revised version. A CD version, without Bernstein's commentary or audience applause, was also released by .
It was performed in 1993 at the Innsbruck Summer Music Festival with Ethan Freeman as Maximillian and Doug Jones as Candide.
It was produced by , performed in the , with direction by Harold Prince, opening November 26, 1994. Book adapted from Voltaire by Hugh Wheeler, lyrics by Richard Wilbur, with additional lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and John Latouche. This revised opera house version formed the basis for the 1997 Broadway Revival.

When the  in the UK (1999) decided to produce , another revision was deemed necessary, and Wheeler's book was rewritten by . This book stuck far closer to Voltaire's original text than any previous version. The songs remained largely as Bernstein intended, bar a few more tweaks from Sondheim and Wilbur. , ,  and  starred, with musical direction by , and a CD released on the RNT's own label.

In the country of , Candide is about to be married to the lovely Cunegonde.  Dr. Pangloss, Candide's teacher, expounds his famous philosophy, to the effect that all is for the best (""The Best of All Possible Worlds"")  The happy couple sing their marriage duet (""Oh, Happy We""), and the ceremony is about to take place (""Wedding Chorale"") when war breaks out between Westphalia and .  Westphalia is destroyed, and Cunegonde is seemingly killed.  Candide takes comfort in the Panglossian doctrine (""It Must Be So"") and sets out on his journeys.
In the public square of  (""Lisbon Fair""), the Infant Casmira, a deranged mystic in the caravan of an Arab conjuror, predicts dire happenings (""The Prediction""), leaving the public in terror (""Pray For Us""). Candide discovers Pangloss, who has contracted , yet remains optimistic (""Dear Boy""*). The  appears, in the persons of two ancient Inquisitors and their lawyer, and many citizens are tried and sentenced to hang, including Candide and Dr. Pangloss (""The Inquisition: Auto-da-Fé""*).  Suddenly an  occurs, killing Dr. Pangloss, and Candide barely escapes.
Candide, faced with the loss of both Cunegonde and Dr. Pangloss, starts out for .  He is unable to reconcile Dr. Pangloss's ideas with the bitter events that have occurred, but concludes that the fault must lie within himself, rather than in the philosophy of  (""It Must Be Me"").
Cunegonde turns up alive in Paris (""The Paris Waltz""), a  in a house shared by a Marquis and a .  A party is in progress.  Urged by the Old Lady, who serves as her , Cunegonde arrays herself in her jewels (""Glitter and Be Gay"").  Candide stumbles into the scene and is amazed to find Cunegonde still alive (""You Were Dead, You Know""). In a duel, he kills both the Marquis and the Sultan, and flees with Cunegonde, accompanied by the Old Lady.
They fall in with a band of devout  on their way to the New World and sail with them (""Pilgrims' Procession"" / ""Alleluia"").  Arriving in Buenos Aires, the group is brought to the Governor's Palace (where Maximilian is alive and working for the Governor), where all except Cunegonde and the Old Lady are immediately enslaved.  A street cleaner appears in the person of the pessimistic Martin, warning Candide of the future. Candide and Maximilian are joyfully reunited, but when Candide states his intention to marry Cunegonde Maximilian starts to strike him with a glove. Candide starts to strike him back, but before he actually does Maximilian drops, apparently dead.  The Governor serenades Cunegonde (""My Love"") and she, abetted by the Old Lady, agrees to live in the palace (""I Am Easily Assimilated""). The Old Lady urges Candide to flee, but Candide, fired by reports of  from Martin, sets off to seek his fortune, planning to return for Cunegonde later (""Quartet Finale"").

In the heat of Buenos Aires, Cunegonde, the Old Lady and the Governor display their fraying nerves  (""Quiet""), and the Governor resolves to get rid of the tiresome ladies.  Candide returns from Eldorado (""Eldorado""), his pockets full of  and searches for Cunegonde.  The Governor, however, has had both Cunegonde and the Old Lady tied up in sacks and carried to a boat in the harbor.  He tells Candide that the women have sailed for Europe, and Candide eagerly purchases a leaky ship from the Governor and dashes off.  As the Governor and his suite watch from his terrace, the ship with Candide and Martin casts off and almost immediately sinks (""Bon Voyage"").
Candide and Martin have been rescued from the ship, and are floating about the ocean on a raft.  Martin is devoured by a , but Dr. Pangloss miraculously reappears.  Candide is overjoyed to find his old teacher, and Pangloss sets about repairing the damage done to his philosophy by Candide's experiences.
In a luxurious palazzo of  (""Money, Money, Money""), Cunegonde turns up as a scrubwoman and the Old Lady as a woman of fashion (Madame Sofronia) (""What's the Use?""), both working as  for Ferone, the owner of a gambling hall.  Candide and Dr. Pangloss, both wearing masks, appear and are caught up by the merriment, the wine and the gambling. Candide is accosted by a masked Cunegonde and Old Lady, who try to steal his remaining gold (""The Venice Gavotte""), but recognizes Cunegonde when her mask falls off. His last hopes and dreams shattered, he drops his money at her feet and leaves.  Cunegonde and the Old Lady are fired by Ferone and Pangloss is now penniless, having been completely swindled out of all his money.
With Candide now completely disillusioned, he and Pangloss return to the ruined Westphalia.  Cunegonde, Maximilian (minus his teeth) and the Old Lady appear and within them a spark of optimism still flickers.  Candide, however, has had enough of the foolish Panglossian ideal and tells them all that the only way to live is to try to make some sense of life (""Make Our Garden Grow"").

The operetta begins with an overture. The chorus welcomes everyone to Westphalia (""Westphalia Chorale"") and Voltaire begins to narrate his story. Candide, the illegitimate nephew of Baron Thunder-ten-Tronck, lives in the Baron's castle Schloss Thunder-ten-Tronck. He is snubbed by the Baroness and bullied by her son Maximilian. Paquette, a very accommodating serving girl, also lives in the castle. However, Candide is in love with Cunegonde, the Baroness' daughter as Maximilian, Candide, Cunegonde and Paquette find their happiness in life (""Life is Happiness Indeed""). The four discover that Dr. Pangloss, a man thought to be the world's greatest philosopher, has taught them happiness (""The Best of All Possible Worlds""). The philosopher asks his four students to summarize what they have learned (""Universal Good""). When Cunegonde spies Dr. Pangloss being physically intimate with Paquette, he explains it away as being a ""physical experiment"", and she decides to share the ""experiment"" with Candide. Professing their love to each other at a park, Candide and Cunegonde dream of what married life would look like (""Oh, Happy We""). The Baron, however, is angered at what Candide has done to Cunegonde, as he is a social inferior. Candide is promptly exiled, wandering alone with his faith and optimism to cling to (""It Must Be So""). He is then shanghaied by and into the Bulgar Army, which plots to ""liberate"" all of Westphalia. His escape attempt fails, and is recaptured by the Army. The Bulgar Army attacks Schloss Thunder-ten-Tronck and in the castle the Baron's family prays as the chorus joins in (""Westphalia""). However, the Baron, the Baroness, Maximilian, Paquette, Pangloss and (after being repeatedly ravished by the Bulgar Army) Cunegonde are all killed in the attack (""Battle Music""). Candide returns to the castle's ruins and searches for Cunegonde (""Candide's Lament"").
Some time later, Candide becomes a beggar. He gives the last of his coins to Pangloss, who reveals that he was revived by an anatomist's . He then tells Candide of his  condition brought on by Paquette (""Dear Boy""). A merchant offers the two employment before sailing off to , Portugal. However, as they arrive, a  erupts and the ensuing earthquake results in the death of 30,000 people. Pangloss and Candide are blamed for the disaster, arrested as heretics and publicly tortured by order of the Grand Inquisitor. Pangloss is  and Candide is  (""Auto-da-Fé""). Candide eventually ends up in , France, where Cunegonde shares her favors (on different mutually-agreed-upon days of the week) with wealthy Jew Don Issachar and the city's Cardinal Archbishop (""The Paris Waltz""). She contemplates what she has done to survive while in Paris (""Glitter and Be Gay""). Candide finds Cunegonde and reunites with her (""You Were Dead, You Know""). However, the Old Lady, Cunegonde's companion, forewarns Cunegonde and Candide of Issachar and the Archbishop's arrival. Candide inadvertently kills both of them by stabbing them with a sword.
The three flee to , Spain with Cunegonde's jewels, where the Old Lady tells Candide and Cunegonde about her past. The jewels are stolen and the Old Lady offers to sing for their dinner (""I Am Easily Assimilated""). The French police arrive, intending to arrest Candide for murdering Don Issachar and the Archbishop. Accepting an offer to fight for the Jesuits in South America, Candide decides to take Cunegonde and the Old Lady to the New World, and the three begin their journey on a ship (""Quartet Finale"").

In , Uruguay, Maximilian and Paquette, now revived and disguised as slave girls, reunite. Soon after, Don Fernando d'Ibaraa y Figueroa y Mascarenes y Lampourdos y Souza, the governor of the city, falls in love with Maximilian, but quickly realizes his mistake and sells him to a priest. Meanwhile, Candide, Cunegonde and the Old Lady also arrive in , where the Governor falls in love with Cunegonde (""My Love""). The Old Lady convinces Cunegonde that her marriage to the governor will support her financially (""We Are Women""). Candide soon befriends Cacambo and accepts him as his valet. Convinced by the Old Lady that the police are still after Candide for the Archbishop's murder, Candide and Cacambo flee Montevideo and eventually stumble upon a Jesuit camp and are joined by the Father and Mother Superiors (""The Pilgrims' Procession – Alleluia""). Candide soon discovers that the Mother Superior is actually Paquette and the Father Superior is Maximilian. When Candide tells Maximilian that he will marry Cunegonde, however, Maximilian angrily challenges him to a fight. However, Maximilian is once again inadvertently stabbed to death by Candide. Candide is forced to flee into the jungle as a result.
Three years later, Cunegonde and the Old Lady discuss the miseries shared by the upper classes while the Governor doesn't want to hear their complaints (""Quiet""). Meanwhile, Candide and Cacambo are starving and lost in the . Finding a boat in the ocean, they float downriver into a cavern for 24 hours until they finally reach , the city of gold (""Introduction to Eldorado""). The two discover that the locals worship one god as opposed to three, palaces of science,  and stones with  and  scents. Dissatisfied without Cunegonde, Candide decides to leave.  The locals think him foolish, but offer to help, giving him some of the town's golden sheep and constructing a lift that will guide him, Cacambo and the sheep over the mountain (""The Ballad of Eldorado""). One by one, the sheep die until only two remain. Unwilling to go back to Montevideo, Candide gives Cacambo one of the golden sheep to ransom Cunegonde, telling them that they will meet again in , Italy.
Arriving at , Candide meets Martin, a local pessimist. He shows him a slave with one hand and one foot lost while harvesting -cane, which is the result of Europeans eating sugar; Candide is unable to convince Martin otherwise (""Words, Words, Words""). Vanderdendur, a Dutch villain, offers his ship, the Santa Rosalia, in exchange for the golden sheep. Candide is excited when he is told that the  is to depart for Venice. The locals and Vandendur wish Candide a safe journey to Venice (""Bon Voyage""). However, the ship sinks and Martin drowns as a result. After reuniting with his golden sheep, Candide is picked up by a , meeting five deposed kings. The galley is rowed by slaves, including Pangloss, revived once again. The kings say that they will live humbly, serving both god and men, and Pangloss leads their debate (""The Kings' Barcarolle"").
The ship arrives in Venice, where the Carnival festival is taking place (""Money, Money, Money""). While the kings play roulette and baccarat, Candide searches for Cunegonde. Maximilian, revived once again, is now the corrupt Prefect of Police and the town's leader. Paquette is now the town's reigning prostitute. Cunegonde and the Old Lady are employed to encourage the gamblers (""What's the Use?""). Pangloss celebrates a victory after winning roulette and spends his money on the other ladies (""The Venice Gavotte""). Candide, however, masked for the Carnival, is accosted by Cunegonde and the Old Lady (both of whom are also masked), who try to swindle him out of his money. During the exchange, all the masks come off and they are horrified to recognize each other.  Seeing what Cunegonde has become, Candide's image of and belief in her is shattered (""Nothing More Than This""). Candide does not speak for several days; with what little money they have left, they purchase a small farm outside Venice and the chorus says that life is just life and paradise is nothing (""Universal Good""). Candide finally speaks and resolves to marry Cunegonde (""Make Our Garden Grow"").
Though the show as a whole received mixed reviews at its opening, the music was immediately a hit. Much of the score was recorded on an , which was a success and is still in print as of 2009.
Cunegonde's   ""Glitter and Be Gay"" is a favourite showpiece for many sopranos. 's performance of the aria at its introduction impressed audience and critics, bringing her wide recognition.
This aria poses some difficulties. If sung as written throughout (alternative phrases are provided at several points in the score), there are three high E-flats (above ), two  and one sustained; there are also numerous uses of high C and D-flat. Some of the florid passages are very intricate. Theatrically, it demands an elaborate comic staging, in which Cunegonde adorns herself with jewelry while singing and dancing around the stage, and has a satirical quality that is a challenge to perform.
Subsequent performers of the role of Cunegonde have included:
This aria has been performed in concert by many musical theatre and opera stars, including (in addition to those listed above): , , , , , , , and .
The  to  soon earned a place in the orchestral repertoire. After a successful first concert performance on January 26, 1957, by the  under the composer's baton, it quickly became popular and was performed by nearly 100 other orchestras within the next two years. Since that time, it has become one of the most frequently performed orchestral compositions by a   composer; in 1987, it was the most often performed piece of concert music by Bernstein.
The overture incorporates tunes from the songs ""The Best of All Possible Worlds"", ""Battle Music"", ""Oh, Happy We"", and ""Glitter and Be Gay"" and melodies composed specifically for the overture.
While many  of the overture exist, in its current incarnation for full symphony orchestra, which incorporates changes made by Bernstein during performances in December 1989, the piece requires a standard-sized contemporary orchestra of , two , two , an E-flat and two B-flat , , two , , four , two , three , , , a large but standard  contingent, , and a standard  section. It is approximately four and a half minutes long. The theatre-sized orchestration, as in the published full score of the operetta, includes one flute doubling on piccolo, one oboe, two clarinets rotating between an E-flat, B-flat, and bass, one bassoon, two horns, two trumpets, two trombones, one tuba, standard orchestral percussion, harp, and strings. Main differences between the two are doublings and increased use of percussion effects (especially the addition of a drum roll during the opening fanfares) in the symphony orchestral arrangement. Differences between the first publication and later printings (of both orchestrations) include a slowed opening tempo (half note equal 132 instead of 152). An arrangement for standard  also exists, composed by Clare Grundman in 1991, published under Boosey and Hawkes.  Peter Richard Conte has also transcribed it for the .

The Pilgrim's Progress,Ralph Vaughan Williams,26 April 1951,"Royal Opera House, London",English,1951,Vaughan Williams," is an opera by , based on 's 1678 allegory . The composer himself described the work as a 'Morality' rather than an opera. Nonetheless, he intended the work to be performed on stage, rather than in a church or cathedral. Vaughan Williams himself prepared the libretto, with interpolations from the Bible and also text from his second wife, . His changes to the story included altering the name of the central character from 'Christian' to 'Pilgrim', so as to universalise the spiritual message.
The musical gestation of this opera was protracted, and was reflected in a number of musical projects in Vaughan Williams' life. For example, his earlier one-act opera  from 1921 was incorporated into Act 4, Scene 2 of the later opera. His  also made use of themes originally conceived for his John Bunyan project.  In 1940 he wrote a motet on Mr. Valiant-for-Truth's speech for mixed chorus.  The BBC commissioned Vaughan Williams for incidental music for a 1942 radio dramatisation of .  has characterised the opera as ""summarizing in three hours virtually the whole creative output of a great composer"". The opera contains forty-one individual singing roles.
The first performance was at the ,  on 26 April 1951. The conductor was Leonard Hancock, whom Vaughan Williams had personally chosen to conduct the premiere, and the director .
The Covent Garden performances were not a success, and the company dropped the opera from its repertoire in 1952. However, a student production at the  in 1954 met with greater approval from the composer, notably for the performance of  as Pilgrim. John Noble later recorded the role in the recording conducted by  in 1970–71 (see  below).
The North American premiere was on 28 April 1969, at , a collaborative effort of the College of Fine Arts and Communications, Music Department, Opera Workshop and Symphony Orchestra.  It was so well received that an encore production was mounted in 1970. In 1972, the year of the centenary of the composer's birth, the work was staged at , where the composer was educated, conducted by William Llewellyn and produced by Geoffrey Ford, again with  as Pilgrim. It was staged again in 1992 at the , with  directing, Igor Kennaway conducting, and Richard Whitehouse singing the role of Pilgrim. Brian Bell directed the opera's Australian premiere in July 1980 performed by the Canberra Opera Society. Three semi-staged productions were performed between 1997 and 2008, conducted by , who also conducted a concert performance for  in 2008.
A major staged production was produced by  at the  in November 2012, conducted by  and directed by Yoshi Oida, with Roland Wood as Pilgrim.
A new production was performed in the Spring of 2019 at the  in Manchester, conducted by  and directed by Jonathan Cocker.

The opera opens to the chords of the psalm tune 'York'. John Bunyan is in Bedford Gaol, completing his book . He stands, faces the audience, and begins to read from the opening of the book. As he does so, a vision of Pilgrim appears, carrying his burden. A  falls to conceal Bunyan, and Pilgrim is alone on stage, reading and in a state of lamentation.

Evangelist directs Pilgrim towards the Wicket Gate. Four neighbours, Pliable, Obstinate, Mistrust and Timorous, appear to warn Pilgrim away from his journey. But Pilgrim dismisses them and continues.

Outside of the House Beautiful, Pilgrim ""stumbles up to the Cross"" and kneels before it. From off-stage, the voices of Three Shining Ones are heard. They then greet Pilgrim and relieve him of his burden. After Pilgrim knocks on the door of the House Beautiful, the Interpreter bids him welcome, as a chorus greets him. The Interpreter marks Pilgrim's forehead in blessing, and after receiving a white robe, Pilgrim enters the House.

Watchful, the house porter, prays for the safety of the house's denizens and for them to enjoy the blessings of sleep.

The Herald asks who will go forth on the King's highway. Pilgrim volunteers, and a scribe notes his name in a book. Pilgrim then receives ""armour of proof"", and begins his journey.

In the Valley of Humiliation, a chorus of Doleful Creatures, howling, surrounds Pilgrim as he enters. Apollyon enters and challenges Pilgrim in single combat, but Pilgrim prevails. The fight has exhausted Pilgrim, but two Heavenly Beings, Branch Bearer and Cup Bearer, restore Pilgrim with leaves from the Tree of Life and water from the Water of Life. Evangelist then returns and gives Pilgrim the Staff of Salvation, the Roll of the Word and the Key of Promise. He also warns Pilgrim to take care at town of Vanity.

At the fair in the town of Vanity, ""all the pleasures of man"" are for sale. Pilgrim enters, and averts his eyes from Vanity Fair as the crowd surrounds him and offers their wares, from Lord Lechery to Madam Bubble and Madam Wanton. The crowd asks what Pilgrim will buy, and he replies: ""I buy the truth!""  The crowd mocks Pilgrim, who denounces them as followers of Beelzebub.  Lord Hate-good then appears, before whom the crowd brings Pilgrim to trial. Witnesses, including Superstition, Envy, Pickthank and Malice, as well as Madam Bubble and Madam Wanton denounce Pilgrim.  Lord Hate-good asks for the crowd's verdict, and they demand death.  Lord Hate-good orders Pilgrim to be imprisoned.

Pilgrim laments that God has forsaken him. In his despair, he clutches at his chest and feels the Key of Promise; after he has put it in the lock, he is instantly freed from prison and his bonds are gone. He resumes his journey.

The Woodcutter's Boy is chopping firewood at the edge of a forest when Pilgrim enters, asking how far there is to go to the Celestial City.  The Boy replies ""not far"", and points out that one can see the Delectable Mountains on a clear day. The Boy then notices Mister and Madam By-Ends as they approach. Mister By-Ends announces that he has become a ""gentleman of quality"". He offers to keep the Pilgrim company on his journey, but Pilgrim replies that those who would travel with him must be willing to stand ""against the wind and tide"". Mister and Madam By-Ends refuse, preferring creature comforts and their ""old principles"" to poverty. They leave, and Pilgrim resumes his journey.


At the Delectable Mountains, three Shepherds are at evening prayer. Pilgrim approaches them and asks if he is on the path to the Celestial City. They reply yes, and after asking why he wishes to journey there, invite Pilgrim to rest with them momentarily. The voice of a bird sings praises to God. A Celestial Messenger appears and tells Pilgrim that ""the Master"" summons him that day. The Messenger ceremonially pierces Pilgrim's heart with an arrow ""with the point sharpened with love"". The Shepherds anoint Pilgrim. The Messenger directs Pilgrim on the path to the Celestial City, to which he must first cross the River of Death. The Shepherds pray for Pilgrim.

In darkness, a trumpet sounds in the distance.  The scene brightens, and voices from Heaven welcome Pilgrim to the Celestial City, at the completion of his journey.

Back in Bedford Gaol, again to the strains of the 'York' psalm tune, Bunyan addresses the audience, holding out his book as an offering.

Die Verurteilung des Lukullus,,,,,1951,,
Wuthering Heights,Bernard Herrmann,"November 6, 1982",Portland Opera,English,1951,Lucille Fletcher," is the sole opera written by . He worked on it from 1943 to 1951. It is cast in a prologue, 4 acts, and an epilogue that repeats the music of the prologue. The opera was recorded in full by the composer in 1966, but it had to wait until April 2011, the centenary of the composer's birth, for a complete theatrical performance (there was an abridged stage production in 1982 and a concert version in 2010).
The  was by Herrmann's first wife, , based on the first part of 's 1847 . Fletcher also interpolated some text from the second part of the novel, and from some unrelated poems by Emily Brontë (such as ""I have been wandering through the Green Woods""). By the time the work was finished, Fletcher and Herrmann had divorced and he had married her cousin Lucy.
Although the work is largely unknown, Lucille Fletcher said it was ""perhaps the closest to his talent and heart"".
Herrmann started work on the opera in April 1943, while composing the film score for  (an adaptation of  by Emily Brontë's sister ). It received a boost in 1946, when Herrmann and Fletcher made a visit to the moor country near , while he was fulfilling conducting engagements with the . There, they visited the  at .

One of the few opportunities to mount a staged production during Herrmann's lifetime was one offered by , but either because Rudel insisted on cuts and a different, up-beat ending, which the composer refused to permit, or because of scheduling challenges – sources differ on the details – the production did not eventuate.  It had earlier been under consideration by Sir , conductor of the Hallé Orchestra, but a perusal of the enormous score caused him to reconsider. It was also briefly considered by the , as a project for  to conduct, but he was unavailable so the idea was dropped. In 1957, the  Opera considered staging it, and Herrmann was convinced it was going ahead, even believing that the contracts had been signed for an April 1958 performance – but it too was dropped.
Its official world stage premiere was on 6 November 1982, almost seven years after Herrmann's death, by the  in Portland, Oregon.  However, that performance omitted 30 to 40 minutes of the music, and the ending was changed to the one Julius Rudel had proposed many years earlier.  was asked to direct the production, but declined. The cast included mezzo-soprano  as Nelly Dean. The production was to have been videotaped for later broadcast on PBS, but this was not done due to the high cost of videotape.

The Rake's Progress,Igor Stravinsky,11 September 1951,"Teatro La Fenice, Venice",,1951,"
"," is an English-language opera from 1951 in three acts and an epilogue by . The , written by  and , is based loosely on the eight paintings and engravings  (1733–1735) of , which Stravinsky had seen on 2 May 1947, in a Chicago exhibition.
The story concerns the decline and fall of one Tom Rakewell, who deserts Anne Trulove for the delights of London in the company of Nick Shadow, who turns out to be the . After several misadventures, all initiated by the devious Shadow, Tom ends up in , a hospital for the insane at that time situated in the City of London. The moral of the tale is: ""For idle hearts and hands and minds the Devil finds work to do.""
It was first performed at the  in Venice on 11 September 1951, with  creating the role of Anne Trulove, and  that of Tom Rakewell. It was first given in Paris at the  on 18 June 1952, under the baton of  and produced by .
The American premiere was on 14 February 1953, at the  in New York, conducted by  and produced by . Although the BBC had previously produced a studio recording (broadcast on 2 January 1953), and the  mounted a staged production at the King's Theatre in Edinburgh in August 1953, the first staging in England was by the same company at the Glyndebourne Festival itself, opening on 15 July 1954.
In 1957, it was a part of the first season of the  under the direction of , who persuaded the composer to attend rehearsals. Stravinsky returned to the SFO each summer through 1963. In 1961,  produced the opera at the  in Stockholm, where it opened on 22 April. The noteworthy 1975  production was directed by , used sets and costumes were designed by , and starred  as Tom Rakewell.

Stravinsky scored the opera for a classical-sized orchestra of two  (one doubling ), two  (one doubling ), two , two , two , two , , ,  (or ) and .
Tom Rakewell is courting Anne Trulove outside her father's house in the country. Father Trulove has doubts about his daughter's proposed marriage and tries to arrange a regular job for Tom; but Tom resists the idea and, left on his own, declares his intention to ""live by my wits and trust to my luck."" When Tom expresses his wish for money, Nick Shadow appears and tells him that an unknown uncle has left him a substantial fortune. He then invites Tom to employ him as a servant and accompany Tom to London to sort out the inheritance.
The second scene, set in Mother Goose's brothel, shows Shadow introducing his new master to the sleazy aspects of London life. But Tom is uneasy and laments his betrayal of love, yet accepts Mother Goose's invitation to spend the night with her. Meanwhile, back in the country, Anne wonders why she has not heard from Tom. She knows somehow that he is in danger, and sets out for London to aid him.
Tom is bored with his dissolute life. He utters his second crucial wish, for happiness, whereupon Nick makes the odd suggestion that he demonstrate his freedom by marrying Baba the Turk, the famous . Soon afterwards Anne finds Tom's London house, only to see him emerge from a sedan chair which also contains Baba, whom he has just married. Tom tells Anne to leave, yet genuinely regrets what has happened.
In the next scene Tom is clearly finding his eccentric marriage intolerable, as Baba is a chatterbox with a fiery temper. He silences her by throwing his wig over her face, then falls asleep. Nick enters with a ""fantastic Baroque Machine"" and demonstrates how, through the use of a hidden compartment in the machine, it appears to turn stones into bread. Tom cries out in his sleep that he wishes it were true, and waking, finds the machine he has dreamt of. Nick hints that if such machines were mass-produced Tom could become a saviour of mankind and Tom sets out to market the machine, not knowing it is a sham.
The plan has failed – the act starts with the auction of the ruined Tom's property by the maniac auctioneer Sellem. The objects for sale include Baba, who has remained immobile since being silenced by the wig. When unwrapped, she resumes her tantrum, now directed at the auction-goers for disturbing her belongings, but calms down when Anne enters. Baba advises her to find Tom and ""set him right"", and warns her against Nick Shadow. She announces her intent to return to her life on the stage.
In a graveyard, Nick reveals his identity and demands payment from Tom, in the form of his soul; but as midnight strikes, Nick offers him an escape in the form of a game of cards; this section is accompanied only by harpsichord. Tom wins, thanks to the benign influence of Anne. Defeated, Nick sinks into the ground, condemning Tom to insanity as he goes. Consigned to Bedlam, Tom believes he is Adonis. Anne (""Venus"") visits him, sings him to sleep, then quietly leaves him. When he realises she has gone, he dies.
In an epilogue, each of the principal characters gives a moral drawn from their scenes in the opera, and then come together to ascribe a final joint moral, ""for idle hands, and hearts and minds, the Devil finds a work to do.""
Shadow (goading Tom into further ridiculous behaviour): 
There have been more than half a dozen recordings of the opera. The Gala recording of the 1951 live performance is available. A Sony recording, with  as Ann and  as Nick Shadow, is from London 1964 and is conducted by Stravinsky himself. It is currently available on the Sony/BMG 22-CD box set .

They agreed on  as a work to be adapted into an opera, with a formal meeting in January 1949 to discuss the project.  Forster worked with , a regular Britten collaborator, to write the libretto.

While Britten was composing the music, the Italian composer  premiered his one-act operatic setting of  at the 1949 Venice International Festival. This disturbed Britten, but Ghedini's opera gained little notice.

HMS Indomitable











Captain Edward Fairfax Vere, an old man, reflects on his life and his time in the navy. He reflects on the conflict between good and evil, tormented by guilt over the case of Billy Budd on board his ship, HMS , some years earlier.
The crew of the  works on deck. For slipping and bumping into an officer, the Novice is sentenced to be flogged. At the same time a cutter approaches, returning from a merchant ship where it has  three sailors into the .
One of these sailors, Billy Budd, seems overjoyed with his situation – entirely different from the other two, Joseph Higgins and Arthur Jones, who are not so happy. Claggart, the , calls him ""a find in a thousand"", despite having a stammer. Billy says a jaunty farewell to the , his former ship, innocent of what his words imply. The officers, forgetting mention of the name of his prior ship, take his words as a deliberate provocation and order the men below decks. Claggart tells Squeak, the ship's corporal, to keep an eye on Billy and give him a rough time.
The Novice is brought back from his flogging, unable to walk and helped along by a friend. The cruelty of the punishment shocks Billy, but he feels certain that if he follows the rules he will be in no danger. Dansker, an old sailor, nicknames Billy ""Baby Budd"" for his naïveté.
At this point in the four-act version, the climax of Act I features Captain Vere on deck to give a speech to the men. In the two-act version, after Billy has asked about the ship's captain, Dansker mentions Captain Vere's nickname, ""Starry Vere,"" and this is enough for the impulsive Billy to swear his loyalty to the unseen captain.
In his cabin, Captain Vere muses over classical literature. His officers Mr Redburn and Mr Flint enter, and they discuss the Revolution in France and the  sparked by French ideas of democracy. The officers warn that Billy may cause trouble, but Vere dismisses their fears and expresses his love for the men under his command.
Below decks, the sailors rough-house, but Dansker remains aloof. Billy goes for some tobacco to cheer him up, and discovers Squeak rifling through his kit. In a rage, Billy begins to stammer. Squeak draws a knife, and fights with Billy, who knocks Squeak to the ground as Claggart and the corporals enter. Billy is still unable to speak, but Dansker relates the events of the fight at Claggart's request.  Claggart sends Squeak to the brig, to keep him silent.  When alone, Claggart reveals his hatred for Billy and vows to destroy him. He orders the Novice to try to bribe Billy into joining a , and the broken-spirited Novice quickly agrees. Billy refuses the bribe and believes he will be rewarded, but Dansker warns him to beware of Claggart.
Claggart asks to see Vere, and after being granted access, begins to tell Vere about danger of mutiny led by one of the crew.  However, the sighting of a French ship interrupts Claggart's narrative. The  goes in pursuit, and fires a warning shot, but loses the enemy in the mist. Claggart returns, and tells Vere that Billy poses a threat of mutiny. Vere does not believe him and sends for Billy so that Claggart may confront him.
Later, in Vere's cabin, Claggart repeats the false charge to Billy's face. Once again, Billy begins to stammer in rage. Unable to speak, he strikes Claggart, killing him. Captain Vere convenes a drumhead court for an immediate .  The officers find Billy guilty and sentence him to hang. Billy begs Vere to save him, and the officers appeal to him for guidance, but Vere remains silent and accepts their verdict. He goes into the cabin where Billy is being held.  The meeting between Captain Vere and Billy Budd is represented by 34 orchestral block chords, with no words.  (This was the end of Act 3 in the four-act version.)
Billy prepares for his execution in his cell. Dansker brings him a drink and reveals that the crew is willing to mutiny for his sake, but Billy argues against that and is resigned to his fate. At four o'clock that morning, the crew assembles on deck, and Billy is brought out. The Articles of War are read, and state that Billy must be hanged. Just before his execution, he praises Vere with his final words, singing ""Starry Vere, God Bless you!"".  Following the execution, the crew begins to mutter in disaffection, which the officers quickly react to suppress.
Vere, as an old man, remembers Billy's burial at sea, and acknowledges that he could have saved Billy, but failed to do so, thinking that Billy has instead blessed and saved him. As he recalls Billy's blessing, he realises he has discovered genuine goodness and can be at peace with himself.

Amahl and the Night Visitors,,"December 24, 1951","NBC Opera Theatre, New York",English,1951,Menotti," is an  in one act by  with an original English  by the . It was commissioned by  and first performed by the  on December 24, 1951, in  at NBC  in , where it was broadcast live on television from that venue as the debut production of the . It was the first  in the United States.
Menotti was commissioned by , director of 's new opera programming, to write the first  for . The composer had trouble settling on a subject for the opera, but took his inspiration from 's  hanging in  in .
As the airdate neared, Menotti had yet to finish the score. The singers had little time to rehearse, and received the final passages of the score just days before the broadcast. The composer's partner  was brought in to complete the orchestrations. After the dress rehearsal, NBC Symphony conductor  told Menotti, ""This is the best you've ever done.""
Menotti distinctly wanted Amahl to be performed by a boy. In the ""Production Notes"" contained in the piano-vocal score he wrote: ""It is the express wish of the composer that the role of Amahl should always be performed by a boy. Neither the musical nor the dramatic concept of the opera permits the substitution of a woman costumed as a child.""
The booklet with the original cast recording contains the following anecdote:
Menotti wrote  with the stage in mind, even though it was intended for broadcast. ""On television you're lucky if they ever repeat anything. Writing an opera is a big effort and to give it away for one performance is stupid."" The composer appeared on-screen in the premiere to introduce the opera and give the background of the events leading up to its composition. He also brought out director  and conductor  to thank them on-screen.
 was seen on 35 NBC affiliates coast to coast, the largest network hookup for an opera broadcast to that date. An estimated five million people saw the live broadcast, the largest audience ever to see a televised opera.
For its first three telecasts, the program had been presented in black-and-white (there were two presentations of it in 1952, one on Easter and one during the Christmas season), but beginning in 1953, it was telecast in color. Because it was an opera, and commercial network television executives had increasingly little confidence in presenting opera on television, it later began to be scheduled, with rare exceptions, as an afternoon television program, rather than shown in  as had been done in its first few telecasts. According to , the first stage performance was presented at , on February 21, 1952, with conductor Ernest Hoffman. The opera's second performance was in Boston on December 18 and 19, 1952. It was presented by the Opera Club at the Agassiz Theatre of Radcliffe College, under the direction of Thomas H. Phillips for the . James Hercules Sutton, 9, soloist for Alfred Nash Patterson at the Church of the Advent, played Amahl; Claire Smith played the mother; Walter Lambert, Paul Johnson and Hermann Gantt played the three kings.
For years,  was presented live, but in 1963 it was videotaped by NBC with conductor  and an all-new cast featuring  as Amahl, Martha King as the Mother, and , , and  as the . This was first television production of ""Amahl"" in which the role of King Balthazar was sung by a real African-American. Earlier productions, including the 1951 original version, had had a white man in blackface singing the role. When Menotti found out that NBC had scheduled the taping on a date when he was out of the country, he tried to get the date changed. The network refused and recorded the 1963 performance without the composer's presence or participation, telecasting it in December 1963, and twice more after that — in 1964 and 1965. Menotti never approved of the 1963 production, and in May 1966 when the rights to future broadcasts reverted to him, the composer refused to allow it to be shown again. Because of this,  was not shown on television at all between 1966 and 1978.
In 1978, a new production starring  as Amahl's mother, Robert Sapolsky as Amahl, and ,  and  as the Three Kings was filmed by NBC, partly on location in the . As was the norm for filmed opera, the music was pre-recorded and the singers mimed their performances to the playback. It did not, however, become an annual tradition the way the 1951 and 1963 versions had.
The BBC made several productions of  in the 1950s. The first performance was broadcast on December 20, 1953, with Charles Vignoles as Amahl, and Gladys Whitred as his mother. The Three Kings were sung by John Lewis (Kaspar), Scott Joynt (Balthasar), and  (Melchior).  was the Page and Josephine Gordon was the dancer. The opera was produced by Christian Simpson and the conductor was Stanford Robinson.
This performance was so successful that it was repeated on Christmas Eve 1954 with substantially the same cast apart from the Page sung by John Carvalho and the dancer, Betty Ferrier. 
Both performances were broadcast live. A  of the 1954 performance was broadcast on Christmas Eve 1956 but this recording seems to have been discarded.
An audio recording of the 1954 performance exists in private hands.
Further performances followed in subsequent years. The 1955 performance was also produced by Christian Simpson, starring Malcolm Day as Amahl, with Gladys Whitred as Amahl's mother. Music was provided by the Sinfonia of London. It appears that this performance was also broadcast live. It was either not recorded or the recording was discarded. It does not exist in the BBC Archives. 
The second production was broadcast on December 24, 1959. This version exists as a 35 mm telerecording in the BBC Archives. This version was again produced by Christian Simpson and starred Christopher Nicholls as Amahl and  as Amahl's mother. This time music was provided by the .
A version was broadcast on  on . It was aired live in Melbourne on 18 December 1957, and was kinescoped to be shown in Sydney on Christmas Day. It is not known if the  recording still exists.
Amahl, a disabled boy who can walk only with a crutch, has a problem with telling tall tales. He is sitting outside playing his shepherd's pipe when his mother calls for him (""Amahl! Amahl!""). After much persuasion, he enters the house but his mother does not believe him when he tells her there is an amazing star ""as big as a window"" outside over their roof (""O Mother You Should Go Out and See""; ""Stop Bothering Me!"").
Later that night, Amahl's mother weeps, praying that Amahl not become a beggar (""Don't Cry Mother Dear""). After bedtime (""From Far Away We Come""), there is a knock at the door and the mother tells Amahl to go see who it is (""Amahl ... Yes Mother!""). He is amazed when he sees three splendidly dressed kings (the ). At first the mother does not believe Amahl, but when she goes to the door to see for herself, she is stunned. The Three Kings tell the mother and Amahl they are on a long journey to give gifts to a wondrous Child and they would like to rest at their house, to which the mother agrees (""Good Evening!""; ""Come In!""), saying that all she can offer is ""a cold fireplace and a bed of straw"". The mother goes to fetch firewood, and Amahl seizes the opportunity to speak with the kings. King Balthazar answers Amahl's questions about his life as a king and asks what Amahl does. Amahl responds that he was once a shepherd, but his mother had to sell his sheep. Now, he and his mother will have to go begging. Amahl then talks with King Kaspar, who is childlike, eccentric, and a bit deaf. Kaspar shows Amahl his box of magic stones, beads, and licorice, and offers Amahl some of the candy (""Are You a Real King?""; ""This is My Box""). The mother returns (""Amahl, I Told You Not to Be a Nuisance!""). He defends himself, saying ""They kept asking me questions,"" when of course it has in fact been Amahl asking the kings questions. Amahl is told to go fetch the neighbors (""All These Beautiful Things""; ""Have You Seen a Child?"") so the kings may be fed and entertained properly (""Shepherds! Shepherds!""; ""Emily! Emily""; ""Olives and Quinces""; ""Dance of the Shepherds"").
After the neighbors have left and the kings are resting, the mother attempts to steal for her son some of the kings' gold that was meant for the  (""All That Gold""). She is thwarted by the kings' page (""Thief! Thief!""). When Amahl wakes to find the page grabbing his mother, he attacks him (""Don't You Dare!""). Seeing Amahl's defense of his mother and understanding the motives for the attempted theft, King Melchior says she may keep the gold as the Holy Child will not need earthly power or wealth to build his kingdom (""Oh, Woman, You Can Keep That Gold""). The mother says she has waited all her life for such a king and asks the kings to take back the gold. She wishes to send a gift but has nothing to send. Amahl, too, has nothing to give the Child except his crutch (""Oh, No, Wait""). When he offers it to the kings, his leg is miraculously healed (""I Walk, Mother""). With permission from his mother, he leaves with the kings to see the Child and give his crutch in thanks for being healed.
For several years it was assumed that the film () of the original telecast had been lost, but a copy was found, transferred to video, and is now available at  (formerly The Museum of Television & Radio) and online at the .

The score of  is varied and makes full use of a range of musical , including ,  and an . The  is sung primarily by Mimaroben, a , who operates the electronic tape, Mima, the computer, and by the . In essence the opera (and poem) deal with the relationship between the individual and the group through time.
Many representatives of the international press were at the  in Stockholm for the premiere in 1959 at a time when the space age was beginning. Blomdahl said in interview that the opera (in common with his next opera ) was founded on ""modern man's complexity and his basically impossible situation"";  dealt with ""the downfall of the group"". A production was mounted in Gothenburg in 1994.

When the Earth is destroyed, Mima cannot continue, and Sandon makes jokes about the safety on board, but when the mute describes in signs the end of the world he becomes silent. Chefone blames Mimaroben, who, with the pilot Isagel, is taken away.
The commander deals as best he can with the increased despair and moral deterioration among those aboard, depicted in a scene in a hall of mirrors, where Daisy Dodd, her lesbian partner, and the passengers dance, and the blind poetess speaks of her cult of Light, which has replaced Mima. 
The body of the dead chief technician is shot into outer space in the direction of the star . The 20th anniversary of the voyage is celebrated, and the blind poetess ecstatically sees the city of heaven, but is taken away.
The final scene shows the last night onboard where Isagel dances and the blind poetess sings of the joy of death. A light beam sweeps over the dead passengers and Mimaroben prepares for the end. Finally darkness descends over the occupants of the space ship, and the audience in the theatre.

A Hand of Bridge,Samuel Barber,"June 17, 1959","Festival of Two Worlds, Spoleto",English,1959,Gian-Carlo Menotti,", opus 35, is an  in one act composed by  with  by , and is possibly the shortest opera that is regularly performed: it lasts about nine minutes. It premiered as a part of Menotti's  in  on 17 June 1959 at the Teatro Caio Melisso. The United States premiere occurred the next year. The opera consists of two unhappily married couples playing a hand of , during which each character has an arietta in which he or she professes his or her inner desires.
, a good friend of Barber's, designed the cover for the opera's vocal score.
The contract begins with 5♥ played by Bill, after the opponents competed in ♣. After setting the stage for the hand the singers begin, one by one, to express their inner monologues. Each arietta unveils the unfulfilled desires of the individual and their isolation, even among lovers and friends.
In chapter three of her dissertation , Elizabeth Lena Smith describes the opera as being separated into the four ariettas that are connected and denoted by the use of the ""card theme."" This theme is used to create a common thread, separate the ariettas into three sections of equal length, and set mood throughout the scene, reflecting each character's outer ""pokerface.""
The card theme is heavily jazz-influenced, with swung rhythms and what Smith calls a ""quasi-walking bass line."" Melodically, the theme is composed of (014) and (015)  separated into triplets. The construction allows the theme to complement the varying styles of each arietta.
Sally, who is frustrated as a result of being  () recalls a hat of peacock feathers she saw in Madame Charlotte's shop window that morning and how much she desires to buy it, which is stated repeatedly throughout her arietta, She second guesses herself about wanting the hat by considering two others, a red one with a tortoiseshell rose and a beige with a fuchsia ribbon, before resolving once again that she wants the hat with peacock feathers.
Sally's arietta has a , with the first section characterized by a repetitive eighth note pattern on the words  The line is sung over pulsating E flat and B flat major triads. The second section shifts to a bi-tonal suggestion of a C flat major melody over an A flat major accompaniment, before returning to the original driving eighth note theme.
Sally's husband Bill, the lawyer, worries that his wife's ""dummy"" outburst is a double-entendre and that she may have discovered his affair with another woman named Cymbaline. He describes his mistress as having ""geranium scented breath,"" and blond hair. He continues his soliloquy with contemplating her whereabouts, jealously wondering who she may be with tonight (), and regretting that he is married to Sally rather than her. Bill's arietta ends with Sally saying, 
Bill's arietta is primarily constructed of scalar triplet figures, creating a romantic waltz that reflects his preoccupation with his mistress, Cymbaline. Toward the closing of his monologue, Bill's forbidden physical desires are expressed by augmented and diminished intervals in his accompaniment on the words, 
Bill is a caricature of one of Barber's neighbors, a business man who hid behind religious pretense.
Geraldine wonders why Bill is so distracted, deciding that it is neither by his wife, whom she refers to as his ""long discarded queen,"" nor herself, with whom he used to play footsie under the card table. Her inner-monologue is lamentful, asking who loves her and whom she loves. She lists the people she knows do not love her: ""the foolish knave of hearts"" in reference to Bill, her father, ""my stock market husband"" in reference to David, and their ""football son."" She then regrets not having a relationship with her dying mother when she had had the chance, begging her not to die now that she is ""learning to love"" her.
Geraldine's lament is set with a G major melody with hints of modal mixture, over a B flat major accompaniment. The only stable moment in the arietta occurs on the subject of Geraldine's ill mother, where the music solidifies on B flat major and the meter changes from 3/2 to 4/2, before returning to the G major melody.
Geraldine is a direct reference to Barber's sister, Sarah, who had an unstable relationship with their mother.
Finally, David, Geraldine's husband, expresses how unhappy he is with his life, stating that his epitaph will read,  He then fantasizes about what he would do if he were as rich or richer than his boss, whom he loathes and envies. He imagines his life in Palm Beach as ""the King of Diamonds,"" with twenty naked girls and boys ""attending to [his] pleasures."" His fantasies further the idea of sexual experimentation with a reference to ""ev'ry known perversion"" in a book by , which he keeps hidden from his wife behind their copy of . In the end he concedes that he could not have that, even if he were rich, and would still play bridge every night with Sally and Bill.
David's arietta is set to a pentatonic melody on the pitches G-A-B-D-E over E and B pedal tones, creating a strong pull towards E minor. The countermelody adds to the sense of exoticism by creating a semi-tone motion with the pitches B and C. Smith concludes that the composition alludes to David's forbidden and suppressed sexual nature.
The first performance took place at Menotti's  in  on 17 June 1959 at the Teatro Caio Melisso, with Robert Feist conducting.
The U.S. premiere occurred the next year on 6 April 1960 in New York at the Mannes College of Music's Fashion Institute of Technology Auditorium, accompanied by the Orchestra of the Mannes College of Music with Carl Bamberger conducting.

It was premiered on 11 June 1960 at the , conducted by the composer and with set and costume designs by .

's production of 2011, directed by , set the opera in a mid-20th-century school, with Oberon () and Tytania () as teachers and Puck and the fairies as schoolboys. Oberon's relationship with Puck (Jamie Manton) is given overtly sexual overtones, and Puck responds with alternate anger and despair to Oberon's new-found interest in Tytania's Changeling boy. The silent older man who stalks the action in the first two acts is revealed to be Theseus (); reviewers have suggested that in this staging Theseus himself was once the object of Oberon's attentions, and is either watching history repeating itself, or is in fact daydreaming the magical events of the opera prior to his marriage to Hippolyta.
 directed a  of an  of """" from the finale of act 3 for his 1998 album  featuring  and .
Britten delineated the three tiers of characters, the rustics being given folk-like ""simple"" music, the lovers a more romantic sound-world and the fairies being represented in a very ethereal way. Almost all of the action now takes place in the woods around , and the fairies inhabit a much more prominent place in the drama. The comic performance by the rustics of  at the final wedding takes on an added dimension as a parody of nineteenth-century Italian opera. Thisbe's lament, accompanied by  , is a parody of a  """" ("""").
The opera contains several innovations: it is extremely rare in opera that the lead male role is written for the  voice to sing. The part of Oberon was created by . Britten wrote specifically for his voice, which, despite its ethereal quality, had a low range compared to more modern countertenors. Oberon's music almost never requires the countertenor to sing both at the top of the alto range and .
The plot of the opera follows that of the , with several alterations. Most of Shakespeare's act 1 is cut, compensated for by the opera's only added line: ""Compelling thee to marry with Demetrius."" Therefore, much greater precedence is given to the wood, and to the fairies. This is also indicated by the opening  strings, and by the ethereal countertenor voice that is , the male lead, who throughout is accompanied by a characteristic texture of harp and celeste, in the same way that 's appearance is heralded by the combination of trumpet and snare-drum.
The opera opens with a chorus, ""Over hill, over dale"" from 's attendant fairies, played by boy sopranos. Other highlights include Oberon's florid – the exotic celeste is especially notable – aria,""I know a bank"" (inspired by 's ""Sweeter than roses"", which Britten had previously arranged for Pears to sing), Tytania's equally florid ""Come now, a roundel"", the chorus's energetic ""You spotted snakes"", the hilarious comedy of , and the final trio for Oberon, Tytania and the chorus.
 The introduction of a chorus of boy-fairies means that the opera becomes greatly concerned with the theme of purity. It is these juvenile fairies who eventually quell the libidinous activities of the quartet of lovers, as they sing a beautiful melody on the three ""motto chords"" (also on the four ""magic"" chords) of the second act: ""Jack shall have Jill/Naught shall go ill/The man shall have his mare again/And all shall be well."" Sung by boys, it could be considered that this goes beyond irony, and represents an idealised vision of a paradise of innocence and purity that Britten seems to have been captivated by throughout his life.
Britten also pays attention to the play's central motif: the madness of love. Curiously he took the one relationship in the play that is grotesque (that of Tytania and Bottom) and placed it in the centre of his opera (in the middle of act 2). Women in Britten operas tend to run to extremes, being either predators or vulnerable prey, but Tytania is an amalgam; she dominates Bottom, but is herself completely dominated by Oberon and Puck, the couple that are usually considered to really hold power in The Dream. Their cruel pranks eventually quell her , which until she is freed from the power of the love-juice is fiendishly difficult to sing.
Britten also parodied operatic convention in less obvious ways than . Like many other operas,  opens with a chorus, but it is a chorus of unbroken boys' voices, singing in unison. After this comes the entrance of the prima donna and the male lead, who is as far away as possible from 's , and as close as it is possible to get to   of the 18th century.: ""There is an air of baroque fantasy in the music."" Britten's treatment of Puck also suggests parody. In opera, the hero's assistant is traditionally sung by baritones, yet here we have an adolescent youth who speaks, rather than sings.
Britten thought the character of Puck ""absolutely amoral and yet innocent."" Describing the speaking, tumbling Puck of the opera, Britten wrote ""I got the idea of doing Puck like this in Stockholm, where I saw some Swedish child acrobats with extraordinary agility and powers of mimicry, and suddenly realised we could do Puck this way.""
There are many recordings available, including two conducted by the composer, one a live recording of the 11 June 1960 premiere with the complete original cast, the second a studio recording made in 1967 with some of the original cast, Deller as Oberon, Owen Brannigan as Bottom, and Peter Pears elevated from Flute to Lysander, which omits some music from the lovers' awakening early in act 3.

The opera took three years to write, and the planning and libretto-writing took longer than the composing. Tate started with a synopsis, and after Franklin had turned it into a libretto, she acknowledged that ""his great experience as a singer at  and  has been of enormous help to me."" Originally, the first scene would have lasted for eight hours, but ""we managed to whittle it down so that the whole opera lasts a mere two and a quarter hours now.""
Emma Bunting, a poverty-stricken landlady in Victorian London, takes in a gentlemanly lodger who gives financial help to her and her husband George. Slowly it emerges that the lodger is not what he seems, and his religious mania indicates mental and other problems. As the tension mounts and the atmosphere becomes more sinister, Emma agonises over whether to report him to the authorities. The lodger's identity is revealed as .

After the premiere, the editor of  magazine noted the ""highly competent professionalism and the natural feel for the stage that the composer displays"" with the composer able ""to write music that can create both atmosphere and tension; how to write music that can be sung (though some of the conversational passages could have moved at a slightly faster pace): how to use her orchestra both economically and effectively"". He also praised ""the very adroit libretto provided by David Franklin"".
Lewis Foreman describes the opera as dramatically effective, ""with its fog-and-gaslight atmosphere, and a divided set showing two rooms simultaneously. All this is lightened by a series of jolly choruses and the idiosyncratic use of  and . It remains the composer's most considerable operatic achievement.""

In Vazha's poem, Mindia is captured by wizards and held in their lair for several years. Desperate to escape, he tries to commit suicide by eating a snake. Instead of dying, he finds that he has now been conferred with magic powers which allow him to understand the voices of nature–plants, animals, and even waterfalls and mountains. He manages to escape and returns to his native village. It is at this point that the opera begins.
Girls from Mindia's village, including his sweetheart Msia, find him sleeping in a field. Rejoicing at his return, they run off to the village to announce that their hero has returned. Mindia's father, Khevisberi, tells him that in his absence Tshalkhia has killed his brother. According to their tradition,  Khevisberi demands that Mindia take ""blood revenge"" by killing Tshalkhia. However, Mindia's affinity with nature and all life forbids this and he refuses his father's command. The village mocks him as a coward.
Suddenly, the villagers learn that they have been surrounded by invaders. Led by Mindia, they go out to meet the enemy. They return victorious but Khevisberi has been mortally wounded. He expresses as his dying wish that Mindia kill Tshalkhia, as does Msia. Yet again, Mindia refuses. However, when Tshalkhia attacks him, Mindia kills him in self defense. Overcome by remorse, and having lost his magic powers, Mindia leaves the village. Alone in the mountains, he commits suicide with a dagger. The voices of nature return to him as he lies dying.

Like the play, the opera is a  with the only character being that of Krapp. The opera was commissioned jointly by the  and the , Germany. From the very beginning the opera's libretto has existed in three different languages: English (from the original play), French (for the French premiere) and German (for the German premiere). It premiered using the French-language version on RTF radio on 15 May 1961 and had its stage debut in Paris on 3 July 1961 at the . The original stage production was performed by visiting artists from the Städtische Bühnen, notably    singing the title role. The work was next performed at the Städtische Bühnen in February 1962 with Dooley singing the role in German.

In 2003 the work was performed at the  in  with the National Theater Opera Orchestra and baritone  as Krapp.
Mihalovici had asked Beckett if he would write a new libretto for him. Beckett agreed but, not unsurprisingly, found he was unable to write to order. Instead, he persuaded Mihalovici to write music for an existing work and the composer ""chose  because of the new musical possibilities involved in a character who must sing as both a young and an old man, and whose voice on tape must be accompanied by a live .""
It took some fourteen months for the , a score of almost 260 pages, to be completed. From that point, according to James Knowlson, ""Beckett and his German translator  … [literally] sat at the , one on either side of the composer, adapting the text to the music or modifying the score … Beckett sometimes changed his original English text to provide extra 'notes' or different rhythms: so, [for example,] 'incomparable bosom' became 'a bosom beyond compare'.""
""Mihalovici's music is , sparse and highly descriptive, relying heavily on a huge  battery to paint a pungent landscape for Beckett's moods and words. Beats on  suggest a human heartbeat, a swirling  the dizziness of inebriation,   a nauseating anxiety. Inner torture and pain are revealed through the orchestra as Krapp intones  in the present; a lyrical vocal line caresses the pre-recorded monologues of his younger self. The melody for the section of tape which Krapp rewinds and re-listens to numerous times (his happiest moment, curled up with his lover in a gently rocking boat) is ingeniously captured as an  by Mihalovici.""

The Long Christmas Dinner,Paul Hindemith,17 December 1961,Nationaltheater Mannheim,English,1961,Thornton Wilder," (German: ) is an  in one act by , with an English  by  based on his 1931 play of the .

The opera was first staged in Hindemith's own German translation and conducted by him at the  on 17 December 1961. It was then performed in the original English on 13 March 1963 at the , New York City, also conducted by the composer.
A digital recording of the work on the  label was performed in Hindemith's German translation. A commercial recording of the original English version was released by  in 2015.
The opera depicts 90 years in the history of the mid-western Bayard family.
The opera opens with Lucia, wife of Roderick Bayard, setting the table for  dinner. Having finished, she calls down her husband and his mother, who is joining them in their first Christmas dinner in their new house. Over dinner, Roderick's mother, referred to as Mother Bayard, recalls a time in her childhood when  lived where the house now rests; at the time, there was no city, only a church and surrounding forestry. She goes on to discuss the importance of remembering the names of one's ancestors.
The opera moves forward to another Christmas dinner between Roderick, Lucia, and Mother Bayard, this time joined by Roderick's cousin Brandon, who is back from his time spent in . As they eat, Brandon asks Mother Bayard how the two are related. As the years go on, Mother Bayard dies, leaving Lucia, Roderick, and Brandon. All three wonder aloud how long they’ve resided in the Bayard house, remarking on how quickly the time flies. Soon after Mother Bayard dies, Lucia's and Roderick's son Charles is born. Not long after the birth of their son, another baby arrives: Genevieve, their daughter.
Again, the action moves forward in time to a later Christmas dinner which is joined by a grown-up Charles and Genevieve; Roderick, Lucia, and Brandon have all aged significantly. The men give a  to the firm owned and run by the Bayard family, and the women join in on the merriment. Roderick dies shortly after this point in time, leaving behind a devastated Lucia. She, Brandon, Genevieve, and Charles reflect on past Christmas dinners. After a quick change in subject, Genevieve announces to her mother that Charles is engaged to be married, adding that she herself will never marry, so that she may always remain with her mother.
The scene shifts briefly to show the marriage of Charles and his wife, Leonora. The newlyweds join Lucia, Brandon, and Genevieve for Christmas dinner. Not long after Charles and Leonora marry, the couple birth a baby—however, the baby dies in infancy. Brandon dies, and is quickly followed by Lucia. The death of Lucia greatly devastates Genevieve, who is left wondering what to do with her life. On the tail end of Lucia's death is the birth of Leonora's : Sam and Lucia II Bayard. Not long afterward, Roderick Brandon Bayard II is also born.
Leonora and Charles write to the latter's cousin Ermengarde, asking her to stay with them. During dinner one Christmas, Ermengarde and Charles discuss their relations and reminisce about their ancestors. Sam, on holiday leave from the military, joins the family for Christmas dinner along with his twin sister, Lucia II. Sam tells his family to do what they normally do on Christmas Day, so that he may cherish the memory of his family's Christmas dinner. Soon after, he goes off to the  and dies there.
Years later, Roderick II jovially joins the family, talking of his and Lucia II's fun time at the ball. Charles berates Roderick II for getting drunk and making a fool of himself, and reminds him that he will soon enter the family firm. Roderick II lashes out angrily, claiming that the town in which they live is so dull that drinking is the only way to endure it. He angrily storms out as he exclaims that he will move away to a “town where something happens,” despite his mother's pleading that he stay. Lucia leaves soon afterward to travel with her spouse, promising to bring children back with her.
Charles and Ermengarde both fall ill, and an atmosphere of sadness is draped over the household. Eventually, Genevieve snaps, fed up with her life of depression following her mother's death. She informs her family that she will go away to die alone, and leaves.
Charles writes his son a letter, forgiving him for tarnishing the family name and refusing to carry on with the firm. He promises to send him another message the following Christmas, but dies before he is able to do so.
Leonora's health declines as she is left with only a dying Ermengarde in the house. The two try to reflect on just how old the house has become: it is nearly ninety years old by this point. Leonora tells Ermengarde that she may have the house if she wants it, as there are no more children around to inherit it. Leonora leaves the room, and Ermengarde finds a letter sent to the house by Lucia II. Attached are pictures of her children—a boy named Roderick III and a girl named Lucia III—along with a letter, informing her that a new Bayard house has been built by Lucia II and Roderick II. Whilst reading the letter, Ermengarde dies.

He offered this original version of the opera in 1957 to the Royal Opera House, , where the music director, , and the general administrator, , had approved the score for production.  However, following intervention by Sir , the company then demurred on the production and did not stage the work at the time. 
The composer then produced a second version of the opera first performed, at the , , on 9 June 1961, after Martinů's death in 1959.  The second version was first produced in the UK at  on 29 April 1981, conducted by Sir .  The first US production was in 1981, at the , in a production by the  School of Music.

The premiere of the restored version was at The Bregenz Festival in 1999 and this production was later performed at Covent Garden in April 2000, and first performed in the Czech Republic in January 2005. The work's first performance in Greece was  in 2005, using a Greek translation by Ioanna Manoledaki, based closely on the wording of Kazantzakis's novel; the conductor was Christian von Gehren.
The setting is Lykovrissi, a Greek village, where a performance of the Passion Play is scheduled to occur at Easter.  As the story proceeds, the villagers cast in the play take on the personalities of their religious characters.  
The priest Grigoris distributes the roles for the following year's performance of the Passion Play.  Café owner Kostandis is allotted James, the pedlar Yannakos Peter, Michelis is given John, shepherd Manolios is selected as Christ; and Katerina, a widow, is chosen to play Mary Magdalene.  Panait, her lover, is given the role of Judas much against his wish. The actors are blessed and exhorted to live the life of their roles in the coming year. Manolios is engaged to Lenio who asks him when they are to be married, but he cannot think about marriage any longer. The villagers think of their respective roles and about how they correspond to their lives.  
At dawn, singing is heard and a group of Greek refugees arrives in Lykovrissi from a village destroyed by the Turks, led by their priest, Fotis.  Father Grigoris is concerned about the welfare and safety of his fellow villagers and of possible conflicts.  One female refugee dies from hunger, but Father Grigoris blames the death on cholera and uses this to expel the refugees from the village.  Only Katerina offers them practical assistance, but Manolios, Yannakos, Kostandis and Michelis take her lead, find food, and show them the nearby Sarakina mountain where the refugees may rest.
The moral strength of the 'apostles' is tested. Katerina has fallen in love with Manolios and reveals this to Yannakos.  The elder Ladas talks to the simple Yannakos about profiting from the refugees. The latter falls for the dream of wealth rushes off to the refugee camp of wants to relieve the refugees of their possessions.  
Meeting Manolios he warns him about Katerina who then  meets Manolios at a well where they reveal their mutual attraction, but Manolios rejects her and she is desolate.
Yannakos views the ceremony of the laying of the foundation stone of a new village on the mountainside, where an old man asks to be buried along with the bones of his ancestors.  Yannakos, shamed by the poverty and welcome of the refugees, confesses to Fotis that he has come to cheat the refugees, but now gives all his money to help them.
Manolios has been dreaming: of Lenio's reproaches, of Grigoris' exhortations to be worthy of his role, and of Katerina as the Holy Virgin. Lenio enters as he wakens to ask for one last time about their wedding, only for Manolios to reply ambiguously. When Manolios has left, Lenio is lured back by the piping of the shepherd Nikolios.  
Manolios convinces Katerina that their love must be only spiritual, in the same manner as Jesus and Mary Magdalene. She decides to sell her goats to help the refugees.
Manolios appeals to the villagers to help the refugees, and is well received. However the village elders see a threat to their authority.  Manolios is gaining a greater spiritual hold over the villagers, and the elders devise a plan to drive Manolios out of the village.
During Lenio and Nikolios's wedding feast Father Grigoris warns them about the preaching of Manolios and excommunicates him. Michelis, Yannakos and Kostandis stay loyal to Manolios.  Manolios appears and proclaims that the world's suffering will bring bloodshed. The refugees come down from the mountain in a state of misery.  While Manolios preaches charity towards the refugees, Grigoris incites the villagers and Panait kills Manolios on the church steps as refugees enter.  The villagers and the refugees mourn Manolios.  Fotis leads the refugees away, in search of a new home.

The Italian  was written by Nono from an idea by , using documentary texts and poetry by , ""Reportage unter dem Strang geschrieben"" [reportage written under the gallows]; , ""La question"" (""The Torture""); 's introduction to Alleg's poem; 's poem ""La liberté""; ""Our march"" by ; and 's ""To Posterity"" (). The plot concerns a migrant, who travels from  looking for work. Along the way, he encounters protests, arrests and torture. He ends up in a concentration camp, where he experiences the gamut of human emotions. He reaches a river, and realises that everywhere is his home. The opera premiered on 13 April 1961 at the  in Venice. It has a running time of approximately one hour and fifteen minutes.
 was Luigi Nono's first work for the opera stage and is a flaming protest against intolerance and oppression and the violation of human dignity. The year in the title refers to the time of the work's origin. Nono himself said of this work that it ""did mark a beginning for me, but in no sense did it constitute a  or in response to 'divine inspiration' "". It was commissioned for the 1961  by its director Mario Labroca. The first performance was conducted by  on 13 April 1961 at the  in Venice. The stage design was by the radical painter , a friend of Nono's. The premiere was disrupted by , who shouted ""Viva la polizia"" during the torture scene. Nono's opponents accused him of poisoning Italian music. (Nono revised the work into a one-act version for a 1974 performance.) A performance by the  in 1964 was suppressed by the  and other right-wing activists. It was subsequently presented the following year, with Maderna conducting 's production, with  in the cast.
Fabrice Fitch has commented that this work has ""no plot as such"", but rather consists of a series of scenes that illustrate aspects of intolerance. Nono himself interpreted the testimony of his work as follows:
According to the publisher , the ""title of the work has been altered from  to  in order to emphasize the timelessness of the composition.""

Instead of an , a large-scale  chorus, ""Live and be vigilant"", is heard from behind a closed curtain.

A migrant is tired of the hard work in the mines in a foreign land. He is consumed by desire to return to his homeland from which he once fled.

A woman who had given the stranger in the mining village warmth and peace and love, tries to persuade him to stay. When she realizes that her lover is determined to go, she insults him and swears revenge. Nevertheless, she leaves with the migrant.

He has reached a city while a large unauthorized peace demonstration is taking place. The police intervene and arrest some demonstrators, including the migrant, although he was not participating in the rally. His attempt to defend himself remains unsuccessful.

Four police officers set to work to force the prisoners to confess. The man, however, stands firm to his story that he was on the way to his home, which goes through the city, and he therefore had nothing to confess.

All those arrested are brought to torture. The chorus of the tortured cries to the audience, asking whether it was deaf and would behave just like cattle in the pen of shame.

The chorus of prisoners desperately cries for freedom. The four policemen taunt their victims. The hero makes friends with another prisoner from Algeria. They plan to escape together.

The migrant manages to escape with the Algerians from the concentration camp. While originally it had been only his wish to see his home, now his heart burns only with the desire for freedom.

From all sides voices press upon the hero, voices which not only disturb and confuse him, but almost overpower him. The absurdities of contemporary life, such as the bureaucracy – for example, ""registration required"", ""Documents are the soul of the state"", ""certify, authenticate, notarize"" – and sensational newspaper headlines like ""mother of thirteen children was a man"" increase, and the scene ends with a big explosion.

A silent crowd suffers from the impression of the slogans and the explosion. When a woman begins to speak out against war and disaster, it appears to the emigrant as a source of hope in his solitude. Henceforth, the two want to fight together for a better world.

To the hero appears the woman he has left in the mining village, and this confuses him. Together with his companion (compagna) he sends her away. Then the woman transforms herself along with a group of fanatics into ghosts and shadows. In the dream, she sees the migrant, the mine, the mocking slogan ""Arbeit macht frei"" over the entrance of the camp, and she sees the nightmares of the intolerance he holds with his companion, ""Never, never again"". The choir sings Mayakovsky's ""Our march"".

The hero and his companion have reached the great river, which forms the border of his native country. It is flooding; its level increases more and more. The deluge swallows roads, broken bridges, barracks, and crushes houses. Even the migrant and his companion are unable to save themselves. They die an agonizing death.

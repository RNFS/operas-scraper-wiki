Uzeyir Hajibeyov,"September 18, 1885, ",18th,Azerbaijani,"November 23, 1948"," (: ; : , ; September 18, 1885 – November 23, 1948), known as   (Azerbaijani: , Arabic script: , ) was an  composer, , , , and social figure. He is recognized as the father of  composed classical music and opera. Uzeyir Hajibeyov composed the music of the  of  (which was re-adopted after Azerbaijan regained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991). He also composed the anthem used by . He was the first composer of an opera in the Islamic world. He composed that first oriental opera Leyli and Majnun in 1908 and since then Azerbaijani people have been honored him for bringing to life the written masterpiece of the world literature. 
Uzeyir Hajibeyov was born in  in the  of the , which is now part of . His father, Abdul Huseyn Hajibeyov, was the secretary to  for many years, and his mother, Shirin, grew up in the Natavan household. Growing up, Hajibeyov was strongly influenced by Natavan's work.
, often dubbed as the cradle of  music and culture, had a reputation for its musical heritage. The town was also referred to as ""the Music Conservatory of the Caucasus"" because of its many talented musicians and singers. And the fact that Hajibeyov grew up in Shusha explains how at 22, in 1908, with very little formal musical education, he was capable of writing a full-length opera.
Hajibeyov received his early education in a religious school (), where he perfected his  and . Later he studied at a two-year Russian-Azerbaijani school. Here, with the help of his favourite teacher , he familiarized himself with the heritage of the famous classic writers of the East and the West. The richness of the musical performance tradition of Shusha greatly influenced the musical education of Uzeyir Hajibeyov. He would later reflect on his experiences: ""The first musical education I got as a child in Shusha came from best singers and -players. At that time I sang  and tasnifs. The singers liked my voice. They would make me sing and teach me at the same time."" Uzeyir Hajibeyov's first teacher was his uncle , an excellent connoisseur of Azeri folk music. In 1897–1898, when Azerbaijani playwright  and singer  staged the episode  from , 13-year-old Uzeyir sang in the choir.
From 1899 to 1904 Uzeyir Hajibeyov studied at the . There, along with general education, he also acquired music. In this school Hajibeyov learned to play the , the  and the . After his graduation from the Pedagogical Seminary, Uzeyir Hajibeyov was appointed a teacher to the village of  in . Having worked there for a year, Hajibeyov permanently settled in , where he carried on his career in teaching , , ,  and  languages, and . He wrote the  in 1907 and the textbook  in 1908, and had them published by the Orujov Brothers Publishing House in .
Hajibeyov was no stranger to the tragic chaos of war; he lived through the Revolutions of  and , the fall of the  in 1920, and both World Wars. The political repercussions of these military conquests often manifested in other forms of chaos. For example, between 1920 and 1940, the alphabet systems for writing Azeri were changed three times — from Arabic to Latin, and from Latin to Cyrillic — a process which greatly hindered and interrupted the educational and cultural process and may well have been one of the factors influencing Uzeyir Hajibeyov to present his ideas verbally on the musical stage.
Throughout all the tumultuous change in Azerbaijan that took place between 1900 and 1940, one characteristic consistently reflects the character of Uzeyir Hajibeyov. He always searched for ways to merge and integrate the past with the present rather than to discard either form. Rather curiously, even files at the Gori Pedagogical Seminary have shown his persistence in holding on to his own roots even under pressure. On December 3, 1900, when he was 15, it is noted that ""the student, Uzeyir Hajibeyov, was rebuked because he was talking in his native language."" Conversely, when Russian-influenced musicians tried to ban traditional Azerbaijani instruments like the ,  and , Hajibeyov and his colleagues pushed to incorporate them into the Western orchestra, thereby, giving them an even higher status and ultimately a chance to survive. The great composer Ü.Hacıbeyli had the opportunity to open music schools that combined various educational systems. In these schools, national cadres who could integrate into the world music culture were trained. History and music theory of Azerbaijani music were researched and education classes were written.  Uzeyir Hajibeyli  in the field of music education combined and created in Azerbaijan Western and East traditions.
In 1908, Hajibeyov wrote his first opera, , based on the  by the 15th century poet . This would be the first of 7  and 3  that Hajibeyov would compose throughout his life. In , the uniqueness of the traditional modal music of  was incorporated into a Western genre with the use of instruments indigenous to both traditions.
Hajibeyov's second opera  was written in 1909 in a form that was entirely opposite to the first. This time Hajibeyov employed a purely European style.  received raves as a musical composition, but the content was too progressive for the period. In this opera, Hajibeyov advocated that marriage should not be bound by nationality or religion - in essence, it was another form of integration. But this time, it backfired. The story line follows a religious  on his way to  who meets a very beautiful  lady. To his horror, the lovely creature's father turns out to be a swineherd, caring for what, to him, was a forbidden animal. In the end, the sheikh denounces his religion to win the woman. It is said that when the opera was performed, many people were offended and walked out, leaving Hajibeyov with the realization that he had outpaced his generation too much this time. As a result, he made a drastic decision and burned the score. When asked by , his assistant, how he could do that, Hajibeyov replied: ""I didn't destroy my opera. It's my own creation so it's always in my head."" Khalilov said that Hajibeyov went on to use this same magnificent music 27 years later to create , an opera that many acclaim to be his finest.
In contrast to , Hajibeyov's operas  (1910),  (1912),  (1912), and  (1915) were entirely based on Azeri folk music elements, primarily .
In October 2006, the musical comedy  (""The Cloth Peddler"") by Uzeyir Hajibeyov, written in 1913, was announced to be performed on western stages for the first time.
One of Hajibeyov's greatest legacies was bringing forward the idea of establishing a professional music school. Hence the  (known then as the Azerbaijan State Conservatoire), was founded in 1920 and named after Hajibeyov after his death. The school has trained Azerbaijan's finest composers such as , , , , , and . His statue ""sits"" in front of this grand building that is still devoted to the synthesizing Eastern and Western musical traditions.
In 1931, Hajibeyov helped in establishing the Azeri Folk Instruments Orchestra affiliated with the Radio Committee. This orchestra performed European classical pieces, such as those by , , ,  and others. Hajibeyov thus was the first musician to adapt the note system to traditional Azeri musical instruments.
In 1936, Hajibeyov assisted in founding of the Azerbaijani State Choir within the . One of the most serious problems he faced was the mono-voiced repertoire of Azeri folk songs, which allowed harmonization distort style of the song and, on occasion, even alter the melody line when it changed modes. Hajibeyov resolved this problem by using   and -doubling rather than four-part singing in the problematic sections.
Hajibeyov devoted much energy to the idea of integrating woman's role and status into the male-dominated world. The concept of women's emancipation runs through many of his works often in the form of comedy or satirization as in the case when he makes fun of the process of selecting marriage partners, a process hindered by the fact that women were still wearing veils until the 1920s when the Soviet regime prohibited them.
From 1919 to 1920 Hajibeyov served as editor-in-chief for the newspaper , the main governmental media body of the .
In 1927, Hajibeyov published  along with composer . For the first time, more than 300 pieces of Azeri folk music were documented by notation. In 1945, he published the book entitled , which has been translated into several languages including  in 1985 devoted to the centenary of his birth.

Heitor Villa-Lobos,"March 5, 1887",18th,Brazilian,"November 17, 1959","
 (March 5, 1887 – November 17, 1959) was a Brazilian , conductor, cellist, and  described as ""the single most significant creative figure in 20th-century Brazilian art music"". Villa-Lobos has become the best-known South American composer of all time. A prolific composer, he wrote numerous , ,  and vocal works, totaling over 2000 works by his death in 1959. His music was influenced by both Brazilian  and stylistic elements from the European  tradition, as exemplified by his  (Brazilian Bachian-pieces) and his . His Etudes for  (1929) were dedicated to , while his  (1940) were dedicated to his spouse Arminda Neves d'Almeida, a.k.a. ""Mindinha"". Both are important works in the classical guitar repertory.
Villa-Lobos was born in . His father, Raúl, was a civil servant, an educated man of Spanish extraction, a , and an amateur  and musician.  In Villa-Lobos's early childhood, Brazil underwent a period of social revolution and modernisation, abolishing  in 1888 and overthrowing the  in 1889. The changes in Brazil were reflected in its musical life: previously European music had been the dominant influence, and the courses at the  were grounded in traditional  and . Villa-Lobos underwent very little of this formal training. After a few abortive harmony lessons, he learnt music by illicit observation from the top of the stairs of the regular musical evenings at his house arranged by his father. He learned to play , , and . When his father died suddenly in 1899 he earned a living for his family by playing in cinema and theatre orchestras in Rio.
Around 1905 Villa-Lobos started explorations of Brazil's ""dark interior"", absorbing the native Brazilian musical culture. Serious doubt has been cast on some of Villa-Lobos's tales of the decade or so he spent on these expeditions, and about his capture and near escape from cannibals, with some believing them to be fabrications or wildly embellished romanticism. After this period, he gave up any idea of conventional training and instead absorbed the musical influences of Brazil's indigenous cultures, themselves based on  and African, as well as  elements. His earliest compositions were the result of  on the  from this period.
Villa-Lobos played with many local Brazilian street-music bands; he was also influenced by the cinema and  improvised  and . For a time Villa-Lobos became a cellist in a Rio opera company, and his early compositions include attempts at Grand Opera. Encouraged by , a pianist and music publisher, he decided to compose seriously.
On November 12, 1913, Villa-Lobos married the pianist Lucília Guimarães, ended his travels, and began his career as a serious musician. Up until his marriage, he had not learned to play the piano, so his wife taught him the rudiments of the instrument. His music began to be published in 1913. He introduced some of his compositions in a series of occasional chamber concerts (later also orchestral concerts) from 1915–1921, mainly in Rio de Janeiro's .
The music presented at these concerts shows his coming to terms with the conflicting elements in his experience, and overcoming a crisis of identity, as to whether European or Brazilian music would dominate his style. This was decided by 1916, the year in which he composed the symphonic poems  and , the first version of what would become  (although  was not performed until 1929, and  was only completed in 1934 and first performed in 1935). These works drew from native Brazilian legends and the use of ""primitive"" folk material.
European influences did still inspire Villa-Lobos. In 1917  made an impact on tour in Brazil with his . That year Villa-Lobos also met the French composer , who was in Rio as secretary to  at the French Legation. Milhaud brought the music of , , and possibly ; in return Villa-Lobos introduced Milhaud to Brazilian street music. In 1918, he also met the pianist , who became a lifelong friend and champion; this meeting prompted Villa-Lobos to write more piano music.
In about 1918 Villa-Lobos abandoned the use of  for his compositions as a constraint to his pioneering spirit. With the piano suite  (Children's carnival) of 1919–20, Villa-Lobos liberated his style altogether from European Romanticism: the suite, in eight movements with the finale written for piano duet, depicts eight characters or scenes from Rio's Lenten Carnival.
In February 1922, a festival of modern art took place in  and Villa-Lobos contributed performances of his own works. The press were unsympathetic and the audience were not appreciative; their mockery was encouraged by Villa-Lobos's being forced by a foot infection to wear one carpet slipper. The festival ended with Villa-Lobos's , composed as an impression of Brazilian urban life.
In July 1922, Rubinstein gave the first performance of the piano suite  (The Baby's Family), composed in 1918. There had recently been an attempted military  on , and places of entertainment had been closed for days; the public possibly wanted something less intellectually demanding, and the piece was booed. Villa-Lobos was philosophical about it, and Rubinstein later reminisced that the composer said, ""I am still too good for them."" The piece has been called ""the first enduring work of Brazilian modernism"".
Rubinstein suggested that Villa-Lobos tour abroad, and in 1923 he set out for . His avowed aim was to exhibit his exotic sound world rather than to study. Just before he left he completed his  (for ten players and chorus) which was first performed after his arrival in the French capital. He stayed in Paris in 1923–24 and 1927–30, and there he met influential residents including , ,  and . Parisian concerts of his music made a strong impression.
In the 1920s, Villa-Lobos also met the Spanish  , who commissioned a guitar study: the composer responded by writing a set of twelve such pieces, each based on a tiny detail or figure played by Brazilian itinerant street musicians (), transformed into a  that is not merely . The music of chorões also provided the initial inspiration for his , a series of compositions written between 1920 and 1929. The first European performance of , in Paris, caused a storm: L.Chevaillier wrote of it in , ""[...it is] an art [...] to which we must now give a new name.""
In 1930, Villa-Lobos, who was in Brazil to conduct, planned to return to Paris. One of the consequences of the revolution of that year was that money could no longer be taken out of the country, and so he had no means of paying any rents abroad. Thus forced to stay in Brazil, he arranged concerts instead around São Paulo, and composed patriotic and educational music. In 1932, he became director of the  (SEMA), and his duties included arranging concerts including the Brazilian premieres of   and   as well as Brazilian compositions. His position at SEMA led him to compose mainly patriotic and propagandist works. His series of  were a notable exception.
In 1936, at the age of forty-nine, Villa-Lobos left his wife, and became romantically involved with Arminda Neves d'Almeida, who remained his companion until death. Arminda eventually took on the name Villa-Lobos, though Villa-Lobos never divorced his first wife. After Villa-Lobos' death, Arminda became the Director of the  in 1960, until her death in 1985. Arminda was herself a musician and a significant influence on Villa-Lobos. He also dedicated a good number of works to her, including the  and many of the .
Villa-Lobos's writings during the presidency of  (1930–1945) include  for Brazilian nationhood (), and teaching and theoretical works. His  ran to 11volumes,  (two volumes, 1942 and 1946) contained vocal exercises, and  (1940 and 1950) contained patriotic songs for schools and for civic occasions. His music for the film  (The Discovery of Brazil) of 1936, which included versions of earlier compositions, was arranged into orchestral , and includes a depiction of the first  in Brazil in a setting for double choir.
Villa-Lobos published  1941, in which he characterised the nation as a sacred entity whose symbols (including its flag, motto and national anthem) were . Villa-Lobos was the chair of a committee whose task was to define a definitive version of the .
After 1937, during the  period when Vargas seized power by decree, Villa-Lobos continued producing patriotic works directly accessible to mass audiences. Independence Day on September 7, 1939, involved 30,000 children singing the national anthem and items arranged by Villa-Lobos. For the 1943 celebrations he also composed the ballet , which the authorities deemed unsuitable until it was revised. The 1943 celebrations did include Villa-Lobos's hymn  shortly after Brazil's declaring war on Germany and its allies.
Villa-Lobos's status damaged his reputation among certain schools of musicians, among them disciples of new European trends such as ‍—‌which was effectively off limits in Brazil until the 1960s. This crisis was, in part, due to some Brazilian composers finding it necessary to reconcile Villa-Lobos's own liberation of Brazilian music from European models in the 1920s with a style of music they felt to be more universal.
Vargas fell from power in 1945. Villa-Lobos was able, after the end of the war, to travel abroad again; he returned to Paris, and also made regular visits to the United States as well as travelling to , and . He received a huge number of commissions, and fulfilled many of them despite failing health. He composed  for piano, cello (the second one in 1953),  (in 1951 for Segovia, who refused to play it until the composer provided a  in 1956),  (for  in 1953) and  (for  in 1955–56). Other commissions included his Symphony No. 11 (for the  in 1955), and the opera  (1955–56) based on the play by . His prolific output of this period prompted criticisms of note-spinning and banality: critical reactions to his  included the comments ""bankrupt"" and ""piano tuners' orgy"", ""raked the very depths of banality"", ""nothing ... but soupy textures or a bedraggled romantic idea"", and ""truly the kind of music that should never get written, still less performed"".
His music for the film  starring  and , commissioned by  in 1958, earned Villa-Lobos , and he conducted the  recording himself. The film was in production for many years. Originally to be directed by , it was taken over by Hepburn's husband . MGM decided to use only part of Villa-Lobos's music in the actual film, turning instead to  for the rest of the music. From the score, Villa-Lobos compiled a work for soprano soloist, male chorus, and orchestra, which he titled  and recorded it in 1959 in  with Brazilian soprano , an unidentified male chorus, and the  for . The recording was issued both on LP and reel-to-reel tape (United Artist UAC 8007, stereo 7 1/2 IPS).
In June 1959, Villa-Lobos alienated many of his fellow musicians by expressing disillusionment, saying in an interview that Brazil was ""dominated by mediocrity"". In November he died in Rio; his state funeral was the final major civic event in that city before the capital transferred to . He is buried in the  in Rio de Janeiro.
His earliest pieces originated in guitar improvisations, for example  (Pancake) of 1900. The concert series of 1915–21 included first performances of pieces demonstrating originality and virtuosic technique. Some of these pieces are early examples of elements of importance throughout his œuvre. His attachment to the  is demonstrated in  of 1914 and in orchestral transcriptions of some of ' piano  (1918, now lost). Other themes that were to recur in his later work include the anguish and despair of the piece  (1915), a violin sonata including ""histrionic and violently contrasting emotions"", the birds of  (1913), the mother–child relationship (not usually a happy one in Villa-Lobos's music) in  of 1914, and the flowers of  for piano of 1916–18 which reappeared in  for flute and  of 1937.
Reconciling European tradition and Brazilian influences was also an element that bore fruit more formally later. His earliest published work  for cello and piano of 1913 shows a love for the cello, but is not notably Brazilian, although it contains elements that were to resurface later. His three-movement  of 1915 (expanded to six movements c. 1947 to become his String Quartet No. 1) is influenced by European opera, while  of 1914–16 for piano, later arranged for octet and subsequently orchestrated, is radically influenced by the tribal music of the Caripunas Indians of .
With his tone poems  (1917, first performed in Paris in 1929) and  (1917, first performed 1935) he created works dominated by indigenous Brazilian influences. The works use Brazilian folk tales and characters, imitations of the sounds of the jungle and its fauna, imitations of the sound of the nose-flute by the , and not least imitations of the  bird itself.
His meeting with Arthur Rubinstein in 1918 prompted Villa-Lobos to compose piano music such as  of 1919—which was possibly influenced by Rubinstein's playing of Ravel and Scriabin on his South American tours—and  of 1920. The latter piece includes the tempi and expression markings ""vertiginoso e frenético"", ""infernal"" and ""mais vivo ainda"" (faster still).
 of 1919–20 saw Villa-Lobos's mature style emerge; unconstrained by the use of traditional formulae or any requirement for dramatic tension, the piece at times imitates a , children's dances, a , and ends with an impression of the carnival parade. This work was orchestrated in 1929 with new linking passages and a new title, . Naïveté and innocence is also heard in the piano suites  (The Baby's Family) of 1918–21.
Around this time he also fused urban Brazilian influences and impressions, for example in his  of 1921. He included the urban street music of the , who were groups containing flute, clarinet and cavaquinho (a Brazilian guitar), and often also including ,  or . Villa-Lobos occasionally joined such bands. Early works showing this influence were incorporated into the  of 1908–12 assembled by his publisher, and more mature works include the  (1955, replacing a lost and probably unfinished one begun in 1917), and his setting of the poetry of  and Catulo da Paxão Cearense in the  of 1919. His  studies are also influenced by the music of the .
All the elements mentioned so far are fused in Villa-Lobos's Nonet. Subtitled  (A Brief Impression of the Whole of Brazil), the title of the work denotes it as ostensibly chamber music, but it is scored for flute/piccolo, oboe, clarinet, saxophone, bassoon, celesta, harp, piano, a large percussion battery requiring at least two players, and a mixed chorus.
In Paris, his musical vocabulary established, Villa-Lobos solved the problem of his works' form. It was perceived as an incongruity that his Brazilian impressionism should be expressed in the form of quartets and sonatas. He developed new forms to free his imagination from the constraints of conventional musical development such as that required in sonata form. The multi-sectional  form may be seen in the , which is somewhat like a triptych, and the  for voice, flute, clarinet, and cello (1923). The extended  for piano, written for Rubinstein, is a multi-layered work, often requiring notation on several staves, and is both experimental and demanding. Wright calls it ""the most impressive result"" of this formal development. The , or  is a stylised treatment of simple Brazilian folk melodies in a wide variety of moods. A  is a child's singing game, but Villa-Lobos's treatment in the works he gave this title are sophisticated. Another form was the . Villa-Lobos composed more than a dozen works with this title for various instruments, mostly in the years 1924–1929. He described them as ""a new form of musical composition"", a transformation of the Brazilian music and sounds ""by the personality of the composer"".
He also composed between 1930 and 1945 nine pieces he called  (Brazilian Bachian pieces). These take the forms and nationalism of the , and add the composer's love of Bach. He incorporated  in his nationalistic style. Villa-Lobos's use of archaisms was not new (an early example is his  for cello and piano of 1913). The pieces evolved over the period rather than being conceived as a whole, some of them being revised or added to. They contain some of his most popular music, such as No.5 for soprano and eight cellos (1938–1945), and No.2 for orchestra of 1930 (the  movement of which is , ""The little train of the Caipira""). They also show the composer's love for the tonal qualities of the cello, both No.1 and No.5 being scored for no other instruments. In these works the often harsh dissonances of his earlier music are less evident: or, as Simon Wright puts it, they are ""sweetened"". The transformation of  into  is demonstrated clearly by the comparison of No.6 for flute and bassoon with the earlier  for flute and clarinet. The dissonances of the later piece are more controlled, the forward direction of the music easier to discern.  No.9 takes the concept so far as to be an abstract , a complete distillation of the composer's national influences. Villa-Lobos eventually recorded all nine of these works for  in Paris, mostly with the musicians of the French National Orchestra; these were originally issued on LPs and later reissued on CDs. He also recorded the first section of  with  and a group of cellists for .
During his period at SEMA, Villa-Lobos composed five string quartets, nos. to, which explored avenues opened by his public music that dominated his output. He also wrote more music for Segovia, the , which also demonstrate a further formalisation of his composition style. After the fall of the Vargas government, Villa-Lobos returned full-time to composition, resuming a prolific rate of completing works. His concertos—particularly those for the , the harp, and the harmonica—are examples of his earlier  form. The Harp Concerto is a large work, and shows a new propensity to focus on a small detail, then to fade it and bring another detail to the foreground. This technique also occurs in his final opera, , which contains a series of scenes each of which establishes an atmosphere, similarly to the earlier .
Villa-Lobos's final major work was the music for the film  (though in the end, most of his score was replaced with music by ) and its arrangement as  for orchestra, as well as some short songs issued separately. In 1957, he wrote a , whose austerity of technique and emotional intensity ""provide a eulogy to his craft"". His , a sequence of  chorales written in 1958, is a similarly simple setting of Latin biblical texts. These works lack the pictorialism of his more public music.
Except for the lost works, the Nonet, the two concerted works for violin and orchestra, , a number of the symphonic poems, most of his choral music and all of the operas, his music is well represented on the world's recital and concert stages and on compact disc.
When touring Europe with his music he said, ""I don't use folklore, I am the folklore"" () and ""I have not come to learn, I have come to show what I have done up to now"" (), showing that he was quite aware of his unique position among classical composers, and he made good use of his origins to publicise his own works.

Francisco Mignone,,,Brazilian,," (September 3, 1897,  – February 19, 1986, ) was one of the most significant figures in  , and one of the most significant Brazilian composers after . In 1968 he was chosen as Brazilian composer of the year.
A graduate of the  and then of the , Mignone returned to  in 1929 to teach harmony, and in 1933 took a post in  at the Escola Nacional de Música. Mignone was a versatile composer, dividing his output nearly evenly between solo songs, piano pieces, , orchestral works, and choral works. In addition, he wrote five  and eight .
Son of the Italian immigrant flutist Alferio Mignone, Francisco was already making his mark upon the musical world of Brazil by the time he was 10 years old, gaining notoriety around his district playing in the  style. A pianist and orchestra leader at 13, he had gained some fame composing and playing under the pseudonym of , keeping these activities separate from his formal music training.  His works may be divided into three compositional periods. His early works show the Italian influences and  sensibilities of his training in Milan. An orchestral piece from his first opera of this early period was premiered in  by  conducting the , in 1923.
Much of Mignone's music is strongly  in flavor; influenced by the nationalistic movement of his former schoolmate and teacher, the  and writer , Mignone uses the folk and popular melodies and forms of his native Brazil as a basis for his compositions. (Andrade reportedly said, ""In Italian music, Mignone will be one more among a rich and numerous school, to which he does not add anything. Here, he will be of indispensable value."") From 1929 until 1960 his work was most strongly characterized by this nationalism, during which he composed such pieces as the  and his ballets  and . His solo vocal and piano works of this time earned him particular acclaim for their expression of Brazilian musical styles, such as the , the , and the  (waltzes) reminiscent of strolling serenaders.
Mignone's music is noted for its lyricism, colorful instrumentation, and improvisatory style. Most of his early works are tonal, as is typical of the popular and folk music, though later in his career he branched out into polytonal, atonal, and serial writing. In the late 1950s Mignone drifted away from the nationalistic music and toward the then-current trends in academic concert music, composing works such as his 1958 Piano Concerto, which showcase his skillful instrumentation and bravura writing. Mignone was capable of writing in a variety of styles and his works of the early 1960s and beyond are noted for their eclecticism; it is difficult to find any other unifying feature. However, he returned to nationalistic writing toward his last few years.
Mignone was married with Liddy Chiafarelli Mignone who died in a plane crash in 1962 and after that married with Maria Josephina Mignone with whom he frequently played duets.
Mignone died in Rio de Janeiro, age 88. His wife remains an interpreter of his music to this day.

Ivan Zajc,,,Croatian,," (also : , : ; ; August 3, 1832 – December 16, 1914), was a  composer, conductor, director, and teacher who dominated 's musical culture for over forty years.  Through his artistic and institutional reform efforts, he is credited with its revitalization and refinement, paving the way for new and significant Croatian musical achievements in the 20th century. He is often called the Croatian .
Ivan Dragutin Stjepan Zajc was born in , modern-day Rijeka, Croatia. His family migrated from , ; his father, Johann Zaytz, was of Czech descent, and his mother, Anna Bodensteiner was of German descent. His musical talent was evident very early on in his life, as he began to study the  and  at the age of five, performed in public by the age of six, and even began to compose his own music by the age of twelve.  Nevertheless, despite his early musical success, his military bandmaster father was opposed to the idea of a career in music and wanted him to study law instead following the completion of his secondary education.  In the end, Zajc's professors prevailed and he entered the  in 1850 with his father's consent.
Zajc studied in  from 1850 to 1855, under the supervision of  (counterpoint and composition),  (orchestration), and  (dramatic music).  During this period, Zajc took his studies very seriously and regularly won prizes as one of the conservatory's most talented students.  He was awarded first prize at his graduation examination for the opera  (1855), which was performed on stage in the same year.  Zajc's future as a composer and conductor in Milan was secure, but the death of his parents in the meantime forced him to return to Rijeka.
Back home, he accepted the post of conductor and concert master of the Town Theatre Orchestra, taught stringed instruments at the Philharmonic Institute, and simultaneously wrote numerous compositions with his characteristic speed and ease.  In 1860, his opera  was met with great success, though two years later, after a prolonged illness, Zajc chose to move to , where opera and theatre were flourishing.  His eight-year stay there (1862–70) was marked by further success, though he settled for composing operettas rather than operas.  His first Viennese work,  (1863), was enormously well received and his later operettas only served to strengthen his growing reputation.  Yet it was in Vienna that Zajc became involved with the Croatian academic society  and frequently met with young Croatian students.  Influenced by such Croatian cultural figures as bishop  and poets , , , and , Zajc chose patriotism over world fame and returned to Croatia.
Upon his arrival in  in 1870, Zajc was presented with two posts:  director and conductor of the  and director and teacher at the .  It was during this period that Zajc made his colossal contribution to Croatian musical culture, not only through his compositions, but also through his leadership in reorganizing Zagreb's musical institutions.

Boris Papandopulo,25 February 1906,19th,Croatian,16 October 1991," (February 25, 1906 – October 16, 1991) was a   and  of Greek and  descent. He was the son of  nobleman Konstantin Papandopulo and Croatian opera singer Maja Strozzi-Pečić and one of the most distinctive Croatian musicians of the 20th century. Papandopulo also worked as , , ,  and ; however, he achieved the peaks of his career in music as a composer. His composing oeuvre is imposing (counting cca 460 works): with great success he created instrumental (orchestral, concertante, chamber and solo), vocal and instrumental (for solo voice and choir), stage music and film music. In all these kinds and genres he left a string of anthology-piece compositions of great artistic value.
“Born, growing up and being brought up in a family that had always been tightly connected with music and the theatre”, he devoted himself to music very early on. He first of all took private lessons in piano, and then studied composition at the Music Academy in Zagreb (where he attended the lectures of Dugan,  and , and studied composition in and graduated from the class of  in 1929). In , at the , he studied  under Dirk Fock (1928–1930). During two periods (1928–1934 and 1938–1946) he was a conductor of the Croatian Singing Association called Kolo, Zagreb, and from 1931 to 1934 had posts of conductor of the Society Orchestra of the  and choirmaster of the ""Ivan Filipović"" Teachers’ Singing Association (which he himself founded in 1933). From 1935 to 1938, he worked as a teacher at the State Music School in , and was conductor of the Zvonimir Music Association, as well as, from 1940 to 1945, of the  (from 1943 to 1945 he was its director). At the same time he was a conductor of the orchestra of  (1942–1945). After  he was a director of the  (1946–1948 and 1953–1959), while, from 1948 to 1953 he was an opera conductor and a teacher in . He took up his career in  again as a conductor of the  (1959–1968) and then the  (1968–1974). He was a regular guest-conductor of the Komedija Theatre in Zagreb, as well as of the .
Papandopulo's youthful opuses were marked by features of the “national music style”, as it was called, that is, of patterns from  (either direct quotations or in the sense of the raw material and modal scale structures), while cosmopolitan influences are also appreciable: the application of composition technique elements of the :  in structure, with  energy and vital rhythmic movement, elementary touches of  and  musical idioms. Along with a treatment of the instruments that makes great demands on skill, technique and virtuosity, very visible are the optimism and serenity that permeate the music to the full.  Connoisseurs of the composer's oeuvre of the earlier (youthful) creative period pick out as the most successful works his ,  for solo voices, mixed voice choir and orchestra;  for  (published by Breitkopf und Härtel), , a mime  with singing and orchestra; the brilliant, bravura  for Solo Soprano, Violin and Seven Wind Instruments (published by Vienna's ) and the most important Croatian religious works from the end of that period of Papandopulo's creativity – the oratorio for solo voices and a male a cappella choir  and  for soloists and a cappella mixed voice choir.
In his mature creative period, Papandopulo retains elements of folk music idiom, but also addresses the achievements of the European musical , without “departing from the traditional formants of musical cells, from the settled development of motif and facture or the well-established laws of melodic movement.” This period, revolving around the temporal axis of the end of  (1945), lasted until about 1956, and gave rise to a number of very successful compositions marked by recent history – the creation of the new state and events from the National Liberation War (, , , a musical poem for soprano solo, choir and large orchestra, , a symphonic movement for large orchestra).
In time his music became more dissonant, rougher in harmony and melody. In the mid-1950s he integrated into his composing technical arsenal elements of ,  (most vigorously in the late fifties and early sixties; ,  for Classical String Quartet and Jazz Quartet,  for Violin Solo and Jazz Quartet,  and so on). Later,  came in, as did other technical composition techniques of the  in music of the , although he retained an ironical distance from some of them, subjecting them on occasions to irony or parody.
The origin of part of Papandopulo's oeuvre of the 1960s and 1970s is related to his guest appearances and acquaintanceships with musicians in the then divided  (FRG and GDR), where he had opportunities to meet outstanding artistic personalities, as well as recent European musical creation.
Ideologically grounded aesthetic worldviews never inhibited Papandopulo in his choice of non-musical subjects for his own works; he always found, in each one of them, universal ideas, profound human values. At the beginning of this work he found non-musical stimuli in topics related to the older strata of the folk tradition – in “legends, rites and myths” (, a Folk Ritual for the Solo Soprano, Piano and Girl's Choir Op 2, ). Later, after 1950, very curiously, he drew his inspiration from apparently diametrically opposed worldviews. At the same time he would write compositions of religious topics – from the Croatian Catholic mass with traces and elements of  (, the cantata  and a number of smaller religious works) and also monumental works of socialist realism (inspired by the ideology and poetics of the post-war socialist revolution and the , such as the musical-poetical work , the poetic-musical vision , 1943 – cycle of songs to words by ) as well as those inspired by Croatian history (the cantatas  / ,  and the triptych for mixed voice choir and large symphony orchestra  and so on).
Papandopulo went on composing with vigour and inspiration almost to the day of his death, a full 65 years. In all these works he showed himself a master of his craft – a witty musician of inexhaustible and fresh inspiration, very well versed in the technical procedure of composition, of musical forms and the technical capacities of both instruments and voice.
As well as a number of concerts and solo works for individual instruments Papandopulo left a marked trace on the ballet and opera of his time. His six  (, , , , , ) and 15  (, , ,  (ballet suite for two pianos),  (ballet sketch for chamber ensemble),  (pantomime ballet with singing and orchestra), , ) have demonstrated their anthological values in the many repeated performances at home and around the world. He composed music for an impressive number of stage productions and films, and also devoted some of his opuses for children and young people (puppet performances, instrumental compositions and instrumental concerti).
A large number of his works feature an authentic and typically Papandopulo buoyant and infectious musical humour (in a large range from tonal play full of brightness to flippancy and rough musical grotesquery) in which he often quotes themes of other authors (, ,  for Two Pianos and Orchestra, , ,  and so on).
It is not possible to give a concise, pithy and yet comprehensive evaluation of Papandopulo's vast oeuvre from today's point of view because of the inaccessibility of the scores.  Nevertheless, , himself a composer, did make an effort in this direction in the following words: “If it were necessary to utter some kind of definition, then a summation of Papandopulo’s oeuvre should be sought in its being some kind of synthesis of all the more important modern influences from world music in combination with rhythmical, melodic and harmonic features of the .”
Irrespective of the time of composition or the stylistic or musical expressive orientation, Papandopulo's “music very easily and spontaneously makes direct contact with the listener”, and musicians are glad to play it.
Boris Papandopulo played an important role as an arranger of folk songs from the wider region () and as populariser and arranger of works of other composers. This particularly refers to anthological compositions of Croatian concertante and operatic music, some of which he revitalised and put on the stage in his own arrangement (some of the works of ,  and , for example).

Though only two of his operas are mentioned in most music literature, he composed another two, together with nine symphonies, several concertos, several ballets. He was both a nationalist and a modernist composer. As early as 1944, he wrote  for piano, using the rhythm of a traditional Ecuadorian dance within the  writing style. He was in his early forties when he started experimenting with new techniques but was not acknowledged as a modernist until later in his life.

From 1956 to 1957, he subsequently studied in Paris with , who had taught many leading composers of the time. Nørgård soon gained his own teaching positions, first at the Odense Conservatory in 1958, and then at the  in 1960. His students at the latter included the composer . Between 1958 and 1962, Nørgård had a stint as a music critic for the newspaper . He left these positions to teach composition at the  in 1965. Here he taught many composers who would go on to have major careers, including , , , ,
To begin with, he was strongly influenced by the Nordic styles of ,  and . In the 1960s, Nørgård began exploring the modernist techniques of central Europe, eventually developing a  compositional system based on the ""infinity series"", which he used in his , the Second and Third Symphonies, , and other works of the late 1960s and 70s. Later he became interested in the Swiss artist , who inspired many of Nørgård's works, including the Fourth Symphony, the opera  and  for solo guitar.
Nørgård has composed works in all major genres: six operas, two ballets, eight symphonies and other pieces for orchestra, several concertos, choral and vocal works, a very large number of chamber works (among them ten string quartets) and several solo instrumental works. These include a number of works for the guitar, mostly written for the Danish guitarist :  (1978),  (1981), a series of suites called  (1985–2001),  (1997–98) and  (1999). One of his most important works for percussion solo is  (1982) for the Danish percussionist Gert Mortensen. He has also composed music for several films, including  (1966),  (1987), and  (1993).

It was later recorded by the  conducted by .
Nørgård is also a prolific writer. He has written many articles dealing with music not only from a technical but also a philosophical viewpoint.
Nørgård's music often features the use of the  ( ) for  melody, harmony, and rhythm in musical composition. The method takes its name from the endlessly  nature of the resulting musical material, comparable to . Mathematically, the infinity series is an . ""Invented in an attempt to unify in a perfect way repetition and variation,"" the first few terms of its simplest form are 0, 1, −1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, −2, 3, ….
Nørgård discovered the melodic infinity series in 1959 and it proved an inspiration for many of his works during the 1960s. However, it was not until his  for small ensemble (1968)—which has been identified as the first ""properly instrumental piece of "" —and Symphony No. 2 (1970) that it provided the structure for an entire work. The harmonic and rhythmic infinity series were developed in the early 1970s and the three series were first integrated in Nørgård's Symphony No. 3.

As early as a 12-year-old Siegfried Saloman already played the violin, so he continued his studies in Copenhagen under the guidance of J. P. E. Hartmann, among others. In 1838 he received a 3-year scholarship which he used to stay in , where he studied music theory and composition with . The last six months of the scholarship period he spent in , where he continued his studies with .
He became a teacher in Copenhagen,  and , where he lived for a few years. Together with his wife, the Swedish  singer Henriette Nissen, he made extensive concert tours in Europe. The couple were married in 1850 in the Netherlands. After his wife's death in 1879 he began living in .
His first songs  and  had no success in Copenhagen, and his third ballad opera,  was not well accepted either. Therefore, in 1847 he left Copenhagen and traveled to Germany where his  was well received in Berlin and Leipzig. In 1850 he was invited to  by , where his comic opera  was written. His Stockholm years were particularly important in his career once several of his early works and a number of new ones were written. He died after a few years of infirmity contracted during a summer stay in the Swedish island of Dalarö.
"
Carl Nielsen,,,Danish,,"

 (; 9 June 1865 – 3 October 1931) was a Danish ,  and , widely recognized as his country's most prominent composer.
Brought up by poor yet musically talented parents on the island of , he demonstrated his musical abilities at an early age. He initially played in a military band before attending the  in Copenhagen from 1884 until December 1886. He premiered his . 1, , in 1888, at the age of 23. The following year, Nielsen began a 16-year stint as a second violinist in the  under the conductor , during which he played in 's  and  at their Danish premieres. In 1916, he took a post teaching at the Royal Danish Academy and continued to work there until his death.
Although his symphonies, concertos and choral music are now internationally acclaimed, Nielsen's career and personal life were marked by many difficulties, often reflected in his music. The works he composed between 1897 and 1904 are sometimes ascribed to his ""psychological"" period, resulting mainly from a turbulent marriage with the sculptor . Nielsen is especially noted for his six , his  and his concertos for ,  and . In Denmark, his opera  and many of his songs have become an integral part of the national heritage. His early music was inspired by composers such as  and , but he soon developed his own style, first experimenting with  and later diverging even more radically from the standards of composition still common at the time. Nielsen's sixth and final symphony, , was written in 1924–25. He died from a heart attack six years later, and is buried in , Copenhagen.
Nielsen maintained the reputation of a musical outsider during his lifetime, both in his own country and internationally. It was only later that his works firmly entered the international repertoire, accelerating in popularity from the 1960s through  and others. In Denmark, Nielsen's reputation was sealed in 2006 when four of his works were  amongst the greatest pieces of Danish . For many years, he appeared on the Danish . The  in Odense documents his life and that of his wife. Between 1994 and 2009 the , sponsored by the Danish government, completed the , freely available online, containing background information and sheet music for all of Nielsen's works, many of which had not been previously published.
Nielsen was born on 9 June 1865, the seventh of twelve children in a poor peasant family, at  near Nørre Lyndelse, south of  on the island of Funen. His father, Niels Jørgensen, was a house painter and  who, with his abilities as a fiddler and cornet player, was in strong demand for local celebrations. Nielsen described his childhood in his autobiography  (). His mother, whom he recalls singing folk songs during his childhood, came from a well-to-do family of sea captains, while one of his half-uncles, Hans Andersen (1837–1881), was a talented musician.
Nielsen gave an account of his introduction to music: ""I had heard music before, heard father play the violin and cornet, heard mother singing, and, when in bed with the measles, I had tried myself out on the little violin."" He had received the instrument from his mother when he was six. He studied violin and piano as a child, and wrote his earliest compositions at the age of eight or nine: a lullaby, now lost, and a polka that he mentions in his autobiography. As his parents did not believe he had any future as a musician, they apprenticed him to a shopkeeper in a nearby village when he was fourteen. The shopkeeper went bankrupt by midsummer and Nielsen had to return home. After learning to play , on 1 November 1879 he became a  and  in the band of the army's 16th Battalion in Odense.
Nielsen did not give up the violin during his time with the battalion, continuing to play it when he went home to perform at dances with his father. The army paid him three  and 45  and a loaf of bread every five days for two and a half years, after which his salary was raised slightly, enabling him to buy the civilian clothes he needed to perform at barn dances.
In 1881, Nielsen began to take his violin playing more seriously, studying privately under Carl Larsen, the  at . It is not known how much Nielsen composed during this period, but from his autobiography, it can be deduced that he wrote some trios and quartets for brass instruments, and that he had difficulty in coming to terms with the fact that brass instruments were tuned in different keys. Following an introduction to , the director of the  in Copenhagen, by whom he was well received, Nielsen obtained his release from the military band at short notice, and studied at the Academy from the beginning of 1884.
Though not an outstanding student and composing little, Nielsen progressed well in violin under  (1832–1907), and received a solid grounding in  from  (1844–1905), who would remain a valued adviser during his early years as a professional composer. He also studied composition under Gade, whom he liked as a friend but not for his music. Contacts with fellow students and cultured families in Copenhagen, some of whom would become lifelong friends, became equally important. The patchy education resulting from his country background left Nielsen insatiably curious about the arts, philosophy and aesthetics. But, in the opinion of the musicologist , it also left him ""with a highly personal, common man's point of view on those subjects"". He left the Academy at the end of 1886, after graduating with good but not outstanding marks in all subjects. He then went to stay with the retired Odense merchant Jens Georg Nielsen (1820–1901) and his wife at their apartment on Slagelsegade as he was not yet in a position to pay his own way. While there, he fell in love with their 14-year-old daughter Emilie Demant. The affair was to last for the next three years.
On 17 September 1887, Nielsen played the violin in the  when his  for strings was premiered. Shortly afterwards, on 25 January 1888, his String Quartet in F major was played at one of the private performances of the  (Private Chamber Music Society). While Nielsen considered the Quartet in F to be his official debut as a professional composer, a far greater impression was made by his . Performed at , Copenhagen on 8 September 1888, it was designated by Nielsen as his Op. 1.
By September 1889 Nielsen had progressed well enough on the violin to gain a position with the second violins in the prestigious Royal Danish Orchestra which played at Copenhagen's , then conducted by Johan Svendsen. In this position he experienced Giuseppe Verdi's  and  at their Danish premieres. Although this employment sometimes caused Nielsen considerable frustration, he continued to play there until 1905. After Svendsen's retirement in 1906, Nielsen increasingly served as conductor (being officially appointed assistant conductor in 1910). Between graduation and attaining this position, he made a modest income from private violin lessons while enjoying the continuing support of his patrons, not only Jens Georg Nielsen but also Albert Sachs (born 1846) and Hans Demant (1827–1897) who both ran factories in Odense. After less than a year at the Royal Theatre, Nielsen won a scholarship of 1,800 kroner, giving him the means to spend several months travelling in Europe.
While travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against 's , heard many of Europe's leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of  and , he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist  in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor , who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in , on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a ""love match"", but also a ""meeting of minds""; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a ""strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career"". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.
Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his ""psychological"" period. Fanning writes, ""At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera  and the  and the cantatas  and "". Carl suggested divorce in March 1905 and had considered moving to Germany for a fresh start, but despite several extended periods of separation the Nielsens remained married for the remainder of the composer's life.
Nielsen had five children, two of them illegitimate. He had already fathered a son, Carl August Nielsen, in January 1888, before he met Anne Marie. In 1912, an illegitimate daughter was born – Rachel Siegmann, about whom Anne Marie never learned. With his wife Nielsen had two daughters and a son. Irmelin, the elder daughter, studied music theory with her father and in December 1919 married Eggert Møller (1893–1978), a medical doctor who became a professor at the  and director of the  at the . The younger daughter , who graduated from the , married the Hungarian violinist  (1892–1988) in 1918; he contributed to the promotion of Nielsen's music, both as a violinist and a conductor. Nielsen's son, Hans Børge, was disabled as a result of  and spent most of his life away from the family. He died near Kolding in 1956.
At first, Nielsen's works did not gain sufficient recognition for him to be able to support himself. During the concert which saw the premiere of his  on 14 March 1894 conducted by Svendsen, Nielsen played in the second violin section. The symphony was a great success when played in Berlin in 1896, contributing significantly to his reputation. He was increasingly in demand to write  for the theatre as well as cantatas for special occasions, both of which provided a welcome source of additional income. Fanning comments on the relationship which developed between his programmatic and symphonic works: ""Sometimes he would find stageworthy ideas in his supposedly pure orchestral music; sometimes a text or scenario forced him to invent vivid musical imagery which he could later turn to more abstract use.""
Nielsen's   for soloists, chorus and orchestra was first performed at Copenhagen's  (The Music Society) on 27 April 1897. It was inspired by 's painting  which Nielsen had seen on his honeymoon in Italy in 1891. On one of the copies, he wrote: ""To my own Marie! These tones in praise of love are nothing compared to the real thing.""
Beginning in 1901, Nielsen received a modest state pension – initially 800 kroner per annum, growing to 7,500 kroner by 1927 – to augment his violinist's salary. This allowed him to stop taking private pupils and left him more time to compose. From 1903, he also had an annual retainer from his principal publisher, . Between 1905 and 1914 he served as second conductor at the Royal Theatre. For his son-in-law, Emil Telmányi, Nielsen wrote his Violin Concerto, Op. 33 (1911). From 1914 to 1926, he conducted the Musikforeningen orchestra. In 1916, he took a post teaching at the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen, and continued to work there until his death.
The strain of dual careers and constant separation from his wife led to an extended breach in his marriage. The couple began separation proceedings in 1916, and separation by mutual consent was granted in 1919. In the period 1916–22, Nielsen often lived on Funen retreating to the Damgaard and Fuglsang estates, or worked as a conductor in . The period was one of creative crisis for Nielsen which, coinciding with World War I, would strongly influence his  (1914–16) and  (1921–22), arguably his greatest works according to Fanning. The composer was particularly upset in the 1920s when his long-standing Danish publisher Wilhelm Hansen was unable to undertake publication of many of his major works, including  and .

The sixth and final symphony, , was written in 1924–25. After suffering a serious heart attack in 1925, Nielsen was forced to curtail much of his activity, although he continued to compose until his death. His sixtieth birthday in 1925 brought many congratulations, a decoration from the Swedish government, and a gala concert and reception in Copenhagen. The composer, however, was in a dour mood; in an article in  on 9 November 1925 he wrote: Nielsen's final large-scale orchestral works were his Flute Concerto (1926) and the Clarinet Concerto (1928), of which Robert Layton writes: ""If ever there was music from another planet, this is surely it. Its sonorities are sparse and monochrome, its air rarefied and bracing."" Nielsen's last musical composition, the organ work , was premiered posthumously in 1931 in .
During his final years, Nielsen produced a short book of essays entitled  (1925), followed in 1927 by his memoir . In 1926 he wrote in his diary ""My home soil pulls me more and more like a long sucking kiss. Does it mean that I shall finally return and rest in the earth of Funen? Then it must be in the place where I was born: Sortelung, Frydenlands parish"".
This was not to be. Nielsen was admitted to Copenhagen's National Hospital (Rigshospitalet) on 1 October 1931 following a series of . He died there at ten minutes past midnight on 3 October, surrounded by his family. His last words to them were ""You are standing here as if you were waiting for something"".
He was buried in Copenhagen's Vestre Cemetery; all the music at his funeral, including the hymns, was the work of the composer. After his death, his wife was commissioned to sculpt a monument to him, to be erected in central Copenhagen. She wrote: ""I wanted to take the winged horse, eternal symbol of poetry, and place a musician on its back. He was to sit there between the rushing wings blowing a reed pipe out over Copenhagen."" Dispute about her design and a shortfall in funding meant that erection of the monument was delayed and that Anne Marie herself ended up subsidising it. The   was finally unveiled in 1939.
Nielsen's works are sometimes referred to by CNW numbers, based on the  (CNW) published online by the  in 2015. The CNW catalogue is intended to replace the 1965 catalogue compiled by  and  (FS numbers).
In his , the music critic  emphasizes the breadth of Nielsen's compositions, his energetic rhythms, generous orchestration and his individuality. In comparing him with , he considers he had ""just as much sweep, even more power, and a more universal message"". The  music professor Daniel M. Grimley qualifies Nielsen as ""one of the most playful, life-affirming, and awkward voices in twentieth-century music"" thanks to the ""melodic richness and harmonic vitality"" of his work. Anne-Marie Reynolds, author of , cites Robert Simpson's view that ""all of his music is vocal in origin"", maintaining that song-writing strongly influenced Nielsen's development as a composer.
The Danish sociologist Benedikte Brincker observes that the perception of Nielsen and his music in his home country is rather different from his international appreciation. His interest and background in folk music had special resonance for Danes, and this was intensified during the nationalistic movements of the 1930s and during World War II, when singing was an important basis for the Danes to distinguish themselves from their German enemies. Nielsen's songs retain an important place in Danish culture and education. The musicologist Niels Krabbe describes the popular image of Nielsen in Denmark as being like ""the ugly duckling syndrome"" – a reference to the tale of the Danish writer  –  whereby ""a poor boy ... passing through adversity and frugality ... marches into Copenhagen and ... comes to conquer the position as the uncrowned King"".
While outside Denmark Nielsen is largely thought of as the composer of orchestral music and the opera , in his own country he is more of a national symbol. These two sides were officially brought together in Denmark in 2006 when the Ministry of Culture issued a list of the twelve greatest Danish musical works that included Nielsen’s opera , his Fourth Symphony, and a pair of his Danish folk songs. Krabbe asks the rhetorical question: ""Can 'the national' in Nielsen be demonstrated in the music in the form of particular themes, harmonies, sounds, forms, etc., or is it a pure construct of reception history?""
Nielsen himself was ambiguous about his attitudes to late Romantic German music and to nationalism in music. He wrote to the Dutch composer  in 1909 ""I am surprised by the technical skills of the Germans nowadays, and I cannot help thinking that all this delight in complication must exhaust itself. I foresee a completely new art of pure archaic virtue. What do you think about songs sung in ? We must go back ... to the pure and the clear."" On the other hand, he wrote in 1925 ""Nothing destroys music more than nationalism does ... and it is impossible to deliver national music on request.""
Nielsen studied Renaissance  closely, which accounts for some of the melodic and harmonic content of his music. This interest is exemplified in his  (Three Motets, Op. 55). To non-Danish critics, Nielsen's music initially had a  sound but became increasingly modern as he developed his own approach to what the writer and composer  called progressive tonality, moving from one key to another. Typically, Nielsen's music might end in a different key from that of its commencement, sometimes as the outcome of a struggle as in his symphonies. There is debate as to how much such elements owe to his folk music activities. Some critics have referred to his rhythms, his use of  or , or his frequent use of a  and  in his works, as being typically Danish. The composer himself wrote ""The , as I see it, are the elements which first arouse a deeper interest in music ... [I]t is intervals which surprise and delight us anew every time we hear the cuckoo in spring. Its appeal would be less if its call were all on one note.""
Nielsen's philosophy of music style is perhaps summed up in his advice in a 1907 letter to the Norwegian composer Knut Harder: ""You have ... fluency, so far, so good; but I advise you again and again, my dear Mr. Harder; .""
Nielsen is perhaps most closely associated outside Denmark with his six symphonies, written between 1892 and 1925. The works have much in common: they are all just over 30 minutes long, brass instruments are a key component of the orchestration, and they all exhibit unusual changes in tonality, which heighten the dramatic tension. From its opening bars,  (Op. 7, 1890–92), while reflecting the influence of Grieg and Brahms, shows Nielsen's individuality. In  (Op. 16, 1901–02), Nielsen embarks on the development of human character. Inspiration came from a painting in an inn depicting the  (choleric, phlegmatic, melancholic, and sanguine).
The title of Symphony No. 3,  (Op. 27, 1910–11), is understood by the English composer Robert Simpson to refer to the ""outward growth of the mind's scope"". It fully exploits Nielsen's technique of confronting two keys at the same time and includes a peaceful section with soprano and baritone voices, singing a tune without words. ,  (Op. 29, 1914–16), written during World War I, is among the most frequently performed of the symphonies. In the last movement two sets of  are placed on opposite sides of the stage undertaking a kind of musical duel. Nielsen described the symphony as ""the life force, the unquenchable will to live"".
Also frequently performed is the  (Op. 50, 1921–22), presenting another battle between the forces of order and chaos. A  is given the task of interrupting the orchestra, playing  and out of time, as if to destroy the music. Performed by the  conducted by  at the 1950 , it caused a sensation, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia. In  (without opus number), written 1924–25, and subtitled , the tonal language seems similar to that in Nielsen's other symphonies, but the symphony develops into a sequence of cameos, some sad, some grotesque, some humorous.
Nielsen's two operas are very different in style. The four-act  (Saul and David), written in 1902 to a libretto by , tells the  story of 's jealousy of the young  while  (Masquerade) is a comic opera in three acts written in 1906 to a Danish  by , based on the comedy by .  received a negative press when it was premiered in November 1902 and did no better when it was revived in 1904. By contrast, in November 1906  was a resounding success with an exceptional run of 25 performances over its first four months. Generally considered to be Denmark's national opera, in its home country it has enjoyed lasting success and popularity, attributable to its many  songs, its dances and its underlying ""old Copenhagen"" atmosphere.
Nielsen wrote a considerable number of choral works but most of them were composed for special occasions and were seldom reprised. Three fully-fledged cantatas for soloists, orchestra and choir have, however, entered the repertoire. Nielsen composed  (), Op. 12 (1897) after studying early polyphonic choral style.  Writing in the newspaper , Nanna Liebmann referred to the work as ""a decisive victory"" for Nielsen, and Angul Hammerich of  welcomed its improved clarity and purity. But the  reviewer H.W. Schytte thought Nielsen had been pretentious presenting the lyrics in Latin rather than Danish.  (), Op. 18, Nielsen's second major choral work, sets to music the various phases of sleep including the terror of a nightmare in its central movement which, with its unusual discords, came as a shock to the reviewers at its premiere in March 1905.  (), Op. 42, completed in 1922, has been cited as the most Danish of all Nielsen's compositions as it extols the beauty of Funen's countryside.
Nielsen wrote three concertos: the Violin Concerto, Op. 33 is a middle-period work, from 1911, which lies within the tradition of European classicism, whereas the Flute Concerto (without opus number) of 1926 and the Clarinet Concerto, Op. 57 which followed in 1928 are late works, influenced by the modernism of the 1920s and, according to the Danish musicologist Herbert Rosenberg, the product of ""an extremely experienced composer who knows how to avoid inessentials."" Unlike Nielsen's later works, the Violin Concerto has a distinct, melody-oriented neo-classical structure. The Flute Concerto, in two movements, was written for the flautist , a member of the Copenhagen Wind Quintet which had premiered Nielsen's Wind Quintet (1922). In contrast to the rather traditional style of the Violin Concerto, it reflects the modernistic trends of the period. The first movement, for example, switches between ,  and  before the flute comes to the fore with a  theme in . The Clarinet Concerto was also written for a member of the Copenhagen Wind Quintet, . Nielsen stretches the capacities of instrument and player to the utmost; the concerto has just one continuous movement and contains a struggle between the soloist and the orchestra and between the two principal competing keys, F major and E major.
The wind concertos present many examples of what Nielsen called  (""objectification""). By this term he meant giving instrumentalists freedom of interpretation and performance within the bounds set out by the .
Nielsen's earliest work composed specifically for orchestra was the immediately successful Suite for Strings (1888), which evoked Scandinavian Romanticism as expressed by Grieg and Svendsen. The work marked an important milestone in Nielsen's career as it was not only his first real success but it was also the first of his pieces he conducted himself when it was played in Odense a month later.
The , Op. 17 (1903) stems from Nielsen's stay in Athens which inspired him to compose a work depicting the sun rising and setting over the . The score is a showpiece for orchestra, and has been amongst Nielsen's most popular works.  (), Op. 39 (1907–08) is a  for orchestra based on the Icelandic . In Nielsen's words:
 () for string orchestra was written for the funeral of the Danish painter  in January 1910 and was also played at Nielsen's own funeral.  (), a vigorous nine-minute symphonic poem inspired by 's , was premiered in 1911. The Rhapsodic Overture,  (), draws on  folk tunes but also contains freely composed sections.
Among Nielsen's orchestral works for the stage are  (1919) and  (The Mother), Op. 41 (1920).  was written to accompany a production of 's fairy tale at The Royal Theatre in Copenhagen. The complete score, lasting over 80 minutes, is Nielsen's longest work apart from his operas, but a shorter orchestral suite consisting of the ,  and  is often performed. , written to celebrate the reunification of  with Denmark, was first performed in 1921; it is a setting of patriotic verses written for the occasion.

Nielsen composed several  works, some of them still high on the international repertoire. The Wind Quintet, one of his most popular pieces, was composed in 1922 specifically for the Copenhagen Wind Quintet. Simpson, explaining that Nielsen's fondness of wind instruments was closely related to his love of nature, writes: ""He was also intensely interested in human character, and in the Wind Quintet composed deliberately for five friends; each part is cunningly made to suit the individuality of each player.""Nielsen wrote four string quartets. The , Op. 13 (1889, revised 1900) contains a ""Résumé"" section in the finale, bringing together themes from the first, third and fourth movements.  The , Op. 5 appeared in 1890 and the , Op. 14 in 1898. The music historian Jan Smaczny suggests that in this work ""the handling of texture is confident and far less derivative than in earlier works ... [the quartet] prompts the most regret that Nielsen did not pursue the genre further ... to parallel his later symphonic development"". The  (1904) initially received a mixed reception, with critics uncertain about its reserved style. Nielsen revised it several times, the final version in 1919 being listed as his Op. 44.
The violin was Nielsen's own instrument and he composed four large-scale chamber works for it. The departures from standard procedures in the First Sonata, Op. 9 (1895), including its often sudden  and its terse thematic material, disconcerted Danish critics at its first performance. The Second Sonata, Op. 35 of 1912 was written for the violinist  who earlier that year had premiered the composer's Violin Concerto. The work is an example of the composer's progressive tonality since, although it is stated to be in the key of G minor, the first and final movements end in different keys. The critic  wrote of the premiere (which was given by ), ""The overall impression was of a beautiful, unbroken line – a flow of notes – where in particular a wonderful second subject in the first part and the pure, high sphere of the last part were captivating"". Two other works are for violin solo. The , Op. 48 (1923) was written for Telmányi, and, like Nielsen's  for piano, Op. 32, was inspired by the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. The , Op. 52 (1928) was written as a tribute for the sixtieth birthday of the composer .
Although Nielsen came to compose mainly at the piano, he only composed directly for it occasionally over a period of 40 years, creating works often with a distinctive style which slowed their international acceptance. Nielsen's own piano technique, an echo of which is probably preserved in three  marked ""Carl Nielsen"" at the State Archives in , seems to have been mediocre. Reviewing the 1969 recording of works by the pianist , John Horton commented on the early pieces: ""Nielsen's technical resources hardly measure up to the grandeur of his designs"", whilst characterising the later pieces as ""major works which can stand comparison with his symphonic music"". The anti-romantic tone of the , Op. 8 (1894) was described by a later critic as ""nothing less than a clenched fist straight in the face of all established musical convention"". In Nielsen's words, the , Op. 32 (1917) was ""a really big piece, and I think effective"". It is not only inspired by the work of Bach, especially the , but also by the virtuoso piano arrangements of Bach's music by composers such as , Johannes Brahms and Ferruccio Busoni. Also on a large scale, and from the same year, is the , Op. 41, in which critics have discerned the influences of Brahms and also of , of whom Nielsen had earlier written to a friend ""I think that the public will be utterly unable to grasp Reger's work and yet I am a lot more sympathetic towards his efforts than towards ... "".
All Nielsen's organ works were late compositions. The Danish organist  suggests that his interest was prompted by the  (), and the renewal of the front pipes of the  in the , Hamburg, from 1928 to 1930. Nielsen's last major work – , Op. 58, a 22-minute piece for organ – was composed between June 1930 and February 1931, only a few months before his death.

Over the years, Nielsen wrote the music for over 290 , most of them for verses and poems by well-known Danish authors such as N. F. S. Grundtvig, , Poul Martin Møller, Adam Oehlenschläger and Jeppe Aakjær. In Denmark, many of them are still popular today both with adults and children. They are regarded as ""the most representative part of the country's most representative composer's output"". In 1906, Nielsen had explained the significance of such songs to his countrymen:Of great significance was Nielsen's contribution to the 1922 publication, , of which he was one of the editors together with ,  and . The book contained about 600 melodies, of which about 200 were composed by the editors, and was intended to provide a repertoire for , an integral part of Danish folk culture. The collection was extremely popular and became embedded in the Danish educational system. During the  in World War II, mass song gatherings, using these melodies, were part of Denmark's ""spiritual re-armament"", and after the war in 1945 Nielsen's contributions were characterised by one writer as ""shining jewels in our treasure-chest of patriotic songs"". This remains a significant factor in Danish assessment of the composer.
Between 1994 and 2009 a complete new edition of Nielsen's works, the , was commissioned by the Danish Government (at a cost of over 40 million kroner). For many of the works, including the operas  and , and the complete  music, this was their first printed publication, copies of manuscripts having previously been used in performances. The scores are now all available for download free of charge at the website of the Danish Royal Library (which also owns most of Nielsen's music manuscripts).
Unlike that of his contemporary, the Finn Jean Sibelius, Nielsen's reputation abroad did not start to evolve until after World War II. For some time, international interest was largely directed towards his symphonies while his other works, many of them highly popular in Denmark, have only recently started to become part of the world repertoire. Even in Denmark, many of his compositions failed to impress. It was only in 1897 after the first performance of  that he received support from the critics, to be substantially reinforced in 1906 by their enthusiastic reception of .
Within two months of its successful premiere at the Odd Fellows Concert Hall in Copenhagen on 28 February 1912, the Third Symphony ( was in the repertoire of the , and by 1913 it had seen performances in Stuttgart, Stockholm and Helsinki. The symphony was the most popular of all Nielsen's works during his lifetime and was also played in Berlin, Hamburg, London and Gothenburg. Other works caused some uncertainty, even in Denmark. After the premiere of the Fifth Symphony (1922) one critic wrote: ""The treasure of Danish symphonies and Carl Nielsen's own output have been enriched by a strange and highly original work."" Another, however, described it as a ""bloody, clenched fist in the face of an unsuspecting snob audience"", also qualifying it as ""filthy music from trenches"".
At the end of the 1940s two major biographies of Nielsen appeared in Danish, dominating opinion of the composer's life and work for several decades. Robert Simpson's book  (first edition 1952) was the earliest large-scale study in English.
An international breakthrough came in 1962 when Leonard Bernstein recorded the Fifth Symphony with the  for CBS. The recording helped Nielsen's music to achieve appreciation beyond his home country and is considered one of the finest recorded accounts of the symphony. Nielsen's centenary in 1965 was widely celebrated, both in terms of performances and publications, and Bernstein was awarded the  for his recording of the Third Symphony. In 1988 Nielsen's diaries and his letters to Anne Marie were published, and these, together with a 1991 biography by Jørgen Jensen using this new material, led to a revised objective assessment of the composer's personality. Writing in  on the occasion of Nielsen's 125th anniversary in 1990, the music critic Andrew Pincus recalled that 25 years earlier Bernstein had believed the world was ready to accept the Dane as the equal of Jean Sibelius, speaking of ""his rough charm, his swing, his drive, his rhythmic surprises, his strange power of harmonic and tonal relationships – and especially his constant unpredictability"" (which Pincus believed was still a challenge for audiences). Biographies and studies in English in the 1990s helped to establish Nielsen's status worldwide, to the point at which his music has become a regular feature of concert programming in Western countries.
Writing in  in 2008, the American music critic  compares the ""brute strength"" of Nielsen's symphonies to 's  and  but explains that only now were the Americans slowly beginning to appreciate the Danish composer.
Nielsen did not record any of his works. However, three younger contemporary conductors who had worked with him, , , and Erik Tuxen, did record his symphonies and other orchestral works with the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra between 1946 and 1952. Jensen also made the first  of the Fifth Symphony in 1954. Work carried out by the recently published complete  has revealed that the scores used in these recordings often differ from the composer's original intentions and thus the supposed authenticity of these recordings is now debatable.
There are now numerous recordings of all Nielsen's major works, including complete cycles of the symphonies conducted by, amongst others, ,  and . Over 50 recordings have been made of Nielsen's Wind Quintet.
From 1916, Nielsen taught at the Royal Academy where he became director in 1931, shortly before his death. He also had private students in his earlier days in order to supplement his income. As a result of his teaching, Nielsen has exerted considerable influence on classical music in Denmark. Among his most successful pupils were the composers Thorvald Aagaard, remembered in particular for his songs, , both a conductor and orchestral composer, and  who composed choral and chamber music mainly for his folk music school (Københavns Folkemusikskole). Among his other students were the musicologist , the pianist , the academy professor and symphony composer , the organist Emilius Bangert who played at , and , one of Nielsen's private students who helped with the orchestration of . Nielsen also instructed the conductor and choirmaster , remembered for his interpretations of Baroque music, and , the pianist and composer who became director of the Academy after Nielsen's death.
The Carl Nielsen Society maintains a listing of performances of Nielsen's works, classified by region (Denmark, Scandinavia, Europe apart from Scandinavia and outside Europe) which demonstrates that his music is regularly performed throughout the world. The concerti and symphonies feature frequently in these listings.
The Carl Nielsen International Competition commenced in the 1970s under the auspices of the . A four-yearly violin competition has been held there since 1980. Flute and clarinet competitions were later added, but these have now been discontinued. An international Organ Competition, founded by the city of Odense, became associated with the Nielsen competition in 2009, but from 2015 will be organized separately, based in Odense Cathedral.
In his home country, the Carl Nielsen Museum, in Odense, is dedicated to Nielsen and his wife, Anne Marie. The composer is featured on the  issued by the  from 1997 to 2010. His image was selected in recognition of his contribution to Danish music compositions such as his opera , his  symphony and his many songs including ""Danmark, nu blunder den lyse nat"".
Several special events were scheduled on or around 9 June 2015 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Nielsen's birth. In addition to many performances in Denmark, concerts were programmed in cities across Europe, including London, Leipzig, Kraków, Gothenburg, Helsinki and Vienna, and even further afield in Japan, Egypt and New York. For 9 June, Nielsen's birthday, the Danish National Symphony Orchestra presented a programme in Copenhagen's  featuring , the  and  for a broadcast extending across Europe and the United States.

During 2015, the  scheduled performances of Nielsen's string quartets in Denmark, Israel, Germany, Norway and the UK (at the ). In the UK, the  prepared a concert series on Nielsen beginning on 9 June in . Nielsen's  overture was also the first item for the opening night of the 2015  in London, while his compositions featured in five other concerts of the Prom season. The city of Odense, which has strong connections with Nielsen, developed an extensive programme of concerts and cultural events for the anniversary year.

# operas-scraper-wiki
as a suggestion would like to have a year column also and a librettist column  


For operas: name of opera, premiere date and place, composer, main language, era/style, summary without footnotes and other wikipedia "mess". These will be rewritten.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Opera

"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Opera_composers_by_nationality",

For composers: name, birthdate, date of death (if applicable), place/country of birth, biography again without footnotes, etc, photo.
